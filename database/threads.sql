I used the new link on the topic page to send this e-mail to all supporters of a \"camp\".  Since I sent this from the agreement statement page, it is going to all 4 supporters of all camps in this topic.\r\n\r\nThe system to record such messages in a DB, and then presenting them as a history in a forum isn\'t quite complete.  But I intend on adding this, along with any other e-mails sent through this system, into the DB for forum history purposes when it is complete.\r\n\r\nCurt, in your statement you said:\r\n\r\n<<<< The hard problem comes from the foundational belief that conscious is a thing which exists in humans, but which is somehow different from the human body. It\'s this assumption of separation or difference which creates the hard problem.>>>>\r\n\r\nWhile I\'m sure that this is true for, perhaps the large majority of people that cherish the \"hard problem\" this is certainly not true for my beliefs, and I bet this is also not true for the other two supporters of the competing camp structure to yours.  (right M@KB, and Stathis?)\r\n\r\nSo I propose we make a \"supper camp\" something like the following that contains this POV in which both of our camps are agreed:\r\n\r\nName: Depends on Brain.\r\nTitle: Consciousness depends on the brain, and dies with it.\r\n\r\nMany people believe we have some kind of \"spirit\" or \"soul\" that is some how above, in a different spiritual dimension, or whatever from our physical body.  Many of these people believe this spirit will arise, or be freed, or whatever from the physical body when it dies.  We do not believe anything like this is true.  We believe that everything we consciously experience is part of the physical brain; that when we die, the conscious properties that existed cease to exist, or at best, like the rest of the matter of our body, disassociates as it rots into the rest of the natural entropy of the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently there are two POV branches under the Agreement Statement.  The \"Phenomenal Consciousness\" camp with 2 sub camps and 3 supporters, and the new \"Physicalism\" camp now supported by Curt.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to create the above \"supper\" camp, and then move both of these branches under that supper camp.  Of course, if I moved the Physicalism statement under such a camp, such a change would be in review for 1 week until the change went live.  During this review phase any supporters of the camp could object, and thereby prevent such a change from going live.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is, if I attempted such a change, would any of you object?  (I\'d like to know now, so I don\'t waste the effort attempting such.)  If I don\'t hear any objections, I\'ll go ahead and make these proposed changes.  If there are any objections, I look forward to learning about why and negotiating something that is better for all.\r\n\r\nHow long do you think it will be before someone that believes in a dualistic \"spirit\" is brave enough to create and support a competing camp to such a supper camp?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n','2007-09-29 21:22:27','2007-09-29 21:22:27'),(10,1,73,'\r\nCurt Welch,\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your wonderful contribution to the Canonizer!

For we are only talking about the actual phenomenal qualities of this knowledge which really has nothing to do with whether such phenomenal qualities are miss representing something or not.\r\n\r\nWe believe the perception process to be based on a chain of cause and effect physical events.  There is what we are looking at, beyond our eyes, which is the initial cause of the perception process.  There is also our knowledge of what we are looking at, the final which is the final result of the perception process entirely in our brain.  We believe this conscious knowledge to be composed of phenomenal properties.  \"Red\" is a phenomenal property in our brain that is only related to the surface of something that reflects 700nm light, only because our brain happens to use that phenomenal quality to represent red.\r\n\r\nWe think the red strawberry amongst the green leaves we are aware of is out beyond our eyes, and that we are directly aware of it.  But this is an illusion.  In reality, this knowledge is entirely in our head, in a conscious spirit world model of the reality we perceive.  At the center of this phenomenal 3D world in our brain is the knowledge of our body.  When we stub out toe, the pain is of course produced by the brain.  It only seems like it is in our toe, because the pain is in our knowledge of the toe in our brain, not the real toe it all represents that is part of our foot.  Common phantom limb pain, produced by amputees results because our knowledge of the appendages in our brain is not amputated with the limb.\r\n\r\nInside our knowledge of our head is a knowledge of our \"self\" or \"spirit\" or \"I\".  This is represented as looking out of our knowledge of our eyes.  But of course, this knowledge that is our spirit, unlike most everything else in this conscious spirit world, has no referent in reality.  However, though it has no referent in reality, in no way means it does not exist.  This phenomenal \"spirit\" is what we really and literally spiritually are.  During \"out of body experiences\" this knowledge of our spirit leaves our knowledge of our body, all in the \"spirit world\" of our conscious awareness, all in and dependent on our brain.\r\n\r\nAll this conscious knowledge is composed of ineffable phenomenal properties.  We know the difference between the green leaf and the red strawberry, precisely because of the phenomenal difference between red and green.  We believe it is absurd to think the only way to determine the nature of another intelligence or consciousness is through a \"Turing Test\".  To know such, you simply must ask a question like: \"What is Red like?\"  And in order to know the other mind isn\'t lying, you must be able to \"eff\" this phenomenal quality to the other mind by reproducing whatever it is in the original mind that has this same quality.  This effing would be similar to the way we can know the difference between red represented by the left hemisphere of our brain and green represented in the right hemisphere of our brain.  Once the taste of salt is \"effed\" to another mind, whether this mind be natural or artificial, the response will be something like: \"Oh THAT is what salt tastes like.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe science is on the verge of discovering what, why, and how, these phenomenal properties are, finally resolving this \"hard problem\" of consciousness and many other conundrums of self philosophy has been struggling with forever.  We believe such a discovery will be the most significant, profound and world changing of scientific achievements to date.  For such a discovery will be the literal piercing of this ineffable spiritual veil, that can be thought of as our skull, spiritually freeing us from this isolated, lonely, mortal prison, out into a shared subjective physical world that surely must be much more than just \"behavior\".\r\n\r\nThis theory makes profound predictions about what things like uploading and \"escaping from our mortal spirit prison\" will be like, should it turn out to be true.  A detailed description of such predictions is contained in chapters 5 and 6 of the short story by Brent Allsop entitled \"1229 years after Titanic\" available here: http://home.comcast.net/~brent.allsop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nName:		Arises from Anything\r\nTitle:		Consciousness arises from equivalent abstract physical behavior\r\nParent:		Consciousness is Real\r\n\r\nIn 1995, David Chalmers authored another popular paper describing a \"Principle of organizational invariance\".  http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html In it he argues that things like fading or dancing qualia make a convincing argument that it is much more likely that these phenomenal properties will some how \"arise\" from whatever physical mater is abstractly behaving like the neurons that are responsible for the same.  He admits that it is difficult to imagine how a diverse things as a set of water pipes, or large group of Chinese people could possibly result in such phenomenal properties, but he believes this resolution of the \"hard problem\" is much more likely than it being consistently dependent on or a part of a particular set of matter in a certain well defined state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis camp will be a rewrite of the existing camp with the same name.\r\nThe parent will be changed to be the new \"Consciousness is Real\" camp and thereby be a competitor to Chalmers \"Arises from Anything or \"Principle of organizational invariance\" camp.\r\nName:		Phenomenal Properties\r\nTitle:		Nature Has Ineffable Phenomenal Properties\r\nParent:		Depends on Brain\r\n\r\nWe believe David Chalmers is pushing in the wrong direction in his effort to resolve this \"hard problem\", and that the \"Principle of organizational invariance\" will turn out to be wrong.\r\n\r\nDavid Chalmers, along with most other people that talk about this hard problem often use the term \"physical process\" to refer to what physical science tells us about the stuff our brain is made of, and its causes and effects.  They contrast this with the subjective nature of our ideas.  More often than not, terms like the following are used to relate the two: \"arise from\", \"neural correlate\", \"results in\", \"causes\", and so on.  We believe all such to be a mistaken terminology leading us away from reality.\r\n\r\nWe believe the fundamental critical difference, should instead be only focused on the cause and effect behavior, on the scientifically observable side, and the phenomenal qualities on the subjective side.  Certainly whatever these are must both be included as physical properties of the universe since the universe, by definition includes all that can be observed and experienced.  To say \"physical process gives rise to the subjective\" is to fail to clearly distinguish between what is really important and the fact that it is all included in the \"physical\".\r\n\r\nWe believe that evolution has managed to use something that has a red phenomenal property to represent knowledge of something that reflects 700 nm light, while using something different that has the phenomenal different property, green, to distinguish between and be aware of a different item that reflects 500 nm light.  But when we use cause and effect observation techniques to observe whatever it is our brain is using the phenomenal properties of to represent knowledge, certainly we shouldn\'t expect them to reflect 700 and 500 nm light and so on right?\r\n\r\nAny causally downstream effect can represent its upstream referent.  We might say it can be behaviorally or abstractly \"like\" it. While at the same time the more important and more primal phenomenal quality is lost, and the downstream effect is nothing phenomenally \"like\" it.  This is precisely the meaning of \"ineffable\" and why traditional cause and effect observation can\'t see them, or rather can only see their behavioral effects.\r\n\r\nYet when there is a juicy sweet strawberry in our left field of vision, represented by red in our right hemisphere, we are clearly aware of this because of its difference between whatever it is in our left hemisphere that has a green phenomenal property representing our knowledge of the leaves in our right field of vision.  In this way our conscious world is unified, and we are able to \"eff\" the primal phenomenal difference between them â€“ red on the left, and green on the right.\r\n\r\nPhysical sciences have classified natural elements into the periodic table.  We know, abstractly, much about the behavior of these individual elements consistently across space, time, temperature, and so on.  We believe we will also find phenomenal properties that equally consistently across space and time map into this table.  This is why we believe Chalmers is critically mistaken when he claims anything with a fundamental nature like \"red\" can \"arise\" from anything as diverse as a properly configured set of water pipes.\r\n\r\nOnce we learn the process where these phenomenal properties can be unified together into a single world of conscious awareness across multiple hemispheres of our brain, and across time, we will also find ways to share or eff these phenomenal properties between multiple brains, and indeed be able to have our spiritual knowledge escape the ineffable spirit prison walls that are our skulls and discover much more than just the behavior of the elements in this table that make up the spiritual, if you will, universe.\r\n\r\nChalmers uses Hans Moravec\'s \"Transmigration\" http://www.leaderu.com/truth/2truth05.html thought experiment to make what many take as a powerful argument for the principle of organizational invariance.  You start replacing all the relevant neurons with abstracted silicon counterparts.  When you start you have David Chalmers.  \"The final system, Robot, is in the same situation, processing the same inputs and producing similar behavior, but by hypothesis is experiencing nothing at all.\"\r\n which obviously could not be accurate at all.\r\n\r\nThere must be something in the robots functionally equivalent mind that is the robots knowledge of the strawberry, that is distinguishable from something that is the leaves.  One possibility could be a set of ones for red, and a set of zeros for green.  So when we ask the robot what red is like, it says (if it is not programmed to lie) it must describe its awareness of red as 1, and its awareness of green to be 0, or whatever abstracted non phenomenal difference achieves the functionally equivalent behavior.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis is that whatever it is that has this red property in the system of awareness, when replaced, will be unable to present the same red to the system of unified conscious awareness.  Though the behavior could be modeled by using something like abstracted ones and zeros, and perhaps a slightly more complex system to use a lookup table to lie about it being aware of differing red and green phenomenal properties.  But certainly any such lying system would in no way be a functionally isomorphic system.  And since the primal and phenomenal nature of red and green, and there difference, could not be presented to such a system of unified awareness, when whatever is producing the spot of red is replaced by the silicone equivalent, there must be some kind of vanishing or dancing qualia on that spot of the strawberry in our conscious world of awareness.\r\n\r\nIf it turns out that it is possible to eff \"red\" from one side of a brains hemisphere made of red, to an indistinguishable red in a hemisphere made entirely of abstracted behavior running on silicone, then this theory will be proved wrong.  But we believe that this will turn out to be impossible.  There will be some type of vanishing, fading, or dancing qualia, and the system will be unable to honestly answer the simple question: what is red like for you, how is it different than green, and it will not be able to give an honest answer that is functionally equivalent on a sufficiently fine grained level.\r\n\r\nWe believe this theory that nature has fundamental phenomenal properties, like it has cause and effect behavioral properties, to have significant implications for Nick Bostrom\'s Simulation Argument http://www.simulation-argument.com/ .While behavior can be abstractly simulated at poetically an infinite number of levels, the phenomenal properties are lost as soon as you leave the basement level that has these phenomenal properties that is representing the information.  If this theory turns out to be true, it will make near proof that, the phenomenal properties used by our mind, at least, at a basement level, since abstracted levels, by definition, do not have these fundamental phenomenal properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n','2007-10-08 02:49:37','2007-10-08 02:49:37'),(12,1,73,'\r\nSupporters,\r\n\r\nHere is a draft of a new camp statement and sub structure I intend on submitting to this topic under the \"Depends on Brain\" camp.\r\n\r\nStathis, I want to make this \"Consciousness is Real\" camp sufficient so you will feel comfortable moving your current support down a level from the \"Depends on Brain\" camp, to this more specific new one.

There will be some type of vanishing, fading, or dancing qualia, and the system will be unable to honestly answer the simple question: what is red like for you, how is it different than green, and it will not be able to give an honest answer that is functionally equivalent on a sufficiently fine grained level.\r\n\r\nWe believe this theory that nature has fundamental phenomenal properties, like it has cause and effect behavioral properties, to have significant implications for Nick Bostrom\'s Simulation Argument http://www.simulation-argument.com/ .While behavior can be abstractly simulated at poetically an infinite number of levels, the phenomenal properties are lost as soon as you leave the basement level that has these phenomenal properties that is representing the information.  If this theory turns out to be true, it will make near proof that, the phenomenal properties used by our mind, at least, at a basement level, since abstracted levels, by definition, do not have these fundamental phenomenal properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n','2007-10-08 02:49:37','2007-10-08 02:49:37'),(13,1,1,'\r\nM@KB,\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback about the information being proposed on this topic.\r\n\r\nAs I indicated, I\'m trying to include all the stuff from your statement, and what Stathis has said, that I agree with, into this \"Consciousoness is Real\" statement.

All they are talking about has nothing to do with being fundamentally aware of a simple ineffable phenomenal property.  But I guess you are forcing me to realize there are some similarities to what we claim?  But they claim it is non computable while I claim these phenomenal properties can do computation.  I simply claim the phenomenal natures they do it with are categorically different from any type of computation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you so much for all of this help with this!  I think it is really coming together!\r\n\r\nSo is this \"Consciousness is Real\" camp sufficient for your support as it is here?  If so I\'ll submit it without yet removing the few remaining things Michael might still be objecting to.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nName:		Consciousness is Real\r\nTitle:		Consciousness is real, representative, and a part of our brain\r\nParent:		Depends on Brain\r\n\r\nWe believe consciousness to be real, representational, and composed of phenomenal properties which are categorically different than behavioral properties.\r\n\r\nIn his book: â€œConsciousness explainedâ€ Daniel Dennett claims we donâ€™t experience qualia â€œIt just seems like we do.â€ (P 375)  But the very meaning of to seem is to have knowledge that doesn\'t accurately represent its referent making this an obvious thinking error; for we are only talking about the actual phenomenal qualities of this knowledge which really has nothing to do with whether such phenomenal qualities are misrepresenting something or not.\r\n\r\nWe believe the perception process to be based on a chain of cause and effect physical events.  There is what we are looking at, beyond our eyes, which is the initial cause of the perception process.  There is also our knowledge of what we are looking at which is the final result of the perception process entirely in our brain.  We believe this conscious knowledge to be composed of phenomenal properties.  \"Red\" is a phenomenal property in our brain that is only related to the surface of something that reflects 700nm light, only because our brain happens to use that phenomenal quality to represent it.\r\n\r\nWe think the red strawberry amongst the green leaves we are aware of is out beyond our eyes, and that we are directly aware of it.  But this is an illusion.  In reality, this knowledge is entirely in our head, in a conscious spirit world model of the reality we perceive.  At the center of this phenomenal 3D world in our brain is the knowledge of our body.  When we stub our toe, the pain is produced by the brain.  It only seems like it is in our toe, because the pain is in our knowledge of the toe in our brain, not the real toe it represents that is part of our foot.  Phantom limb pain, produced by amputees, results because our knowledge of the appendages in our brain is not amputated with the limb.\r\n\r\nInside our knowledge of our head (a spiritual head, if you will, representing and entirely contained within our real head) is a knowledge of our \"self\" or \"spirit\" or \"I\".  This \"I\" is represented as looking out of our knowledge of our eyes.  But of course, this knowledge that is our spirit, unlike most everything else in this conscious spirit world, has no referent in reality.  However, though it has no referent in reality, this in no way means it does not exist.  This phenomenal \"spirit\" is what we really and literally spiritually are.  During \"out of body experiences\" this knowledge of our spirit leaves our knowledge of our body, all in the \"spirit world\" of our conscious awareness, all in and dependent on our brain.\r\n\r\nAll this conscious knowledge is composed of ineffable phenomenal properties.  We know the difference between the green leaf and the red strawberry, precisely because of the phenomenal difference between red and green.  We believe it is absurd to think the only way to determine the nature of another intelligence or consciousness is through a \"Turing Test\".  To know such, you simply must ask a question like: \"What is Red like?\"  And in order to know the other mind isn\'t lying, you must be able to \"eff\" this phenomenal quality to the other mind by reproducing whatever it is in the original mind that has this same quality.  This effing would be similar to the way we can know the difference between red represented in the left hemisphere of our brain and green represented in the right hemisphere of our brain.  Once the taste of salt is effed to another mind, whether this mind be natural or artificial, the response will be something like: \"Oh THAT is what salt tastes like.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe science is on the verge of getting an objective handle on these phenomenal properties finally resolving how they work and many other conundrums of self and epistemology philosophy has been struggling with for so long.  We believe such a discovery will be the most significant, profound and world changing of scientific achievements to date.  For such a discovery will be the literal piercing of this ineffable spiritual veil, that can be thought of as our skull, spiritually freeing us from this isolated, lonely, mortal prison, out into a shared subjective physical world that surely must be much more than just \"behavior\".\r\n\r\nThis theory makes profound predictions about what things like uploading and \"escaping from our mortal spirit prison\" will be like, should it turn out to be true.  A detailed description of such predictions is contained in chapters 5 and 6 of the short story by Brent Allsop entitled \"1229 years after Titanic\" available here: http://home.comcast.net/~brent.allsop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nName:		Arises from Anything\r\nTitle:		Consciousness arises from equivalent abstract physical behavior\r\nParent:		Consciousness is Real\r\n\r\nIn 1995, David Chalmers authored another popular paper describing a \"Principle of organizational invariance\" http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html.  In it he argues that the implausibility of fading or dancing qualia make a convincing argument that it is more likely that these phenomenal properties will some how \"arise\" from whatever physical mater is abstractly behaving like the neurons that are responsible for the same.  He admits that it is difficult to imagine how such diverse things as a set of water pipes or set of wind machines could possibly result in such phenomenal properties, but concludes with:\r\n\r\n\"I conclude that by far the most plausible hypothesis is that replacement of neurons while preserving functional organization will preserve qualia, and that experience is wholly determined by functional organization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis camp will be a rewrite of the existing camp with the same name.\r\nThe parent will be changed to be the new \"Consciousness is Real\" camp and thereby be a competitor to Chalmer\'s \"Arises from Anything or \"Principle of organizational invariance\" camp.\r\nName:		Phenomenal Properties\r\nTitle:		Nature Has Ineffable Phenomenal Properties\r\nParent:		Depends on Brain\r\n\r\nWe believe David Chalmers is pushing in the wrong direction in his effort to get a handle on this \"hard problem\", and that the \"Principle of organizational invariance\" will turn out to be wrong.\r\n\r\nDavid Chalmers, and others that talk about this hard problem often use the term \"physical process\" to refer to what physical science tells us about the stuff our brain is made of, and its causes and effects.  They contrast this with the subjective nature of our ideas.  More often than not, terms like the following are used to relate the two: \"arise from\", \"neural correlate\", \"results in\", \"causes\", \"supervenes on\" and so on.  We believe all such to be a mistaken terminology leading us away from reality.\r\n\r\nWe believe the fundamental critical difference, should instead be only focused on the cause and effect behavior, on the scientifically observable side, and the phenomenal qualities on the subjective side.  Certainly whatever these are must both be included as physical properties of the universe since the universe, by definition includes all that can be observed and experienced.  To say \"physical process gives rise to the subjective\" is to fail to clearly distinguish between what is really important and the fact that it is all included in the \"physical\".\r\n\r\nWe believe that evolution has managed to use something that has a red phenomenal property to represent knowledge of something that reflects 700 nm light, while using something different that has the phenomenal different property, green, to distinguish between and be aware of a different item that reflects 500 nm light.  But when we use cause and effect observation techniques to observe whatever it is our brain is using the phenomenal properties of to represent knowledge, certainly we shouldn\'t expect them to reflect 700 and 500 nm light and so on right?\r\n\r\nAny causally downstream effect can represent its upstream referent.  We might say it can be behaviorally or abstractly \"like\" it. While at the same time the more important and more primal phenomenal quality is lost, and the downstream effect is nothing phenomenally \"like\" it.  This is precisely the meaning of \"ineffable\" and why traditional cause and effect observation can\'t see them, or rather can only see their behavioral effects.\r\n\r\nYet when there is a juicy sweet strawberry in our left field of vision, represented by red in our right hemisphere, we are clearly aware of this because of its difference between whatever it is in our left hemisphere that has a green phenomenal property representing our knowledge of the leaves in our right field of vision.  In this way our conscious world is unified, and we are able to \"eff\" the primal phenomenal difference between them\r\n\r\nPhysical sciences have classified natural elements into the periodic table.  We know, abstractly, much about the behavior of these individual elements consistently across space, time, temperature, and so on.  We believe we will also find phenomenal properties that equally consistently across space and time map into this table.  This is why we believe Chalmers is critically mistaken when he claims anything with a fundamental nature like \"red\" can \"arise\" from anything as diverse as a properly configured set of water pipes.\r\n\r\nOnce we learn the process where these phenomenal properties can be unified together into a single world of conscious awareness across multiple hemispheres of our brain, and across time, we will also find ways to share or eff these phenomenal properties between multiple brains, and indeed be able to have our spiritual knowledge escape the ineffable spirit prison walls that are our skulls and discover much more than just the behavior of the elements in this table that make up the spiritual, if you will, universe.\r\n\r\nChalmers uses Hans Moravec\'s \"Transmigration\" http://www.leaderu.com/truth/2truth05.html thought experiment to make what many take as a powerful argument for the principle of organizational invariance.  You start replacing all the relevant neurons with abstracted silicone counterparts.  When you start you have David Chalmers.  \"The final system, Robot, is in the same situation, processing the same inputs and producing similar behavior, but by hypothesis is experiencing nothing at all.\"\r\n which obviously could not be accurate at all.\r\n\r\nThere must be something in the robots functionally equivalent mind that is the robots knowledge of the strawberry that is distinguishable from something that is the leaves.  One possibility could be a set of ones for red, and a set of zeros for green.  So when we ask the robot what red is like, it says (if it is not programmed to lie) it must describe its awareness of red as 1, and its awareness of green to be 0, or whatever abstracted non phenomenal difference achieves the functionally equivalent behavior.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis is that whatever it is that has this red property in the system of awareness, when replaced, will be unable to present the same red to the system of unified conscious awareness.  Though the behavior could be modeled by using something like abstracted ones and zeros, and perhaps a slightly more complex system to use a lookup table to lie about it being aware of differing red and green phenomenal properties.  But certainly any such lying system would in no way be a functionally isomorphic system.  And since the primal and phenomenal nature of red and green, and their difference, could not be presented to such a system of unified awareness, when whatever is producing the spot of red is replaced by the silicone equivalent, there must be some kind of vanishing or dancing qualia on that spot of the strawberry in our conscious world of awareness.\r\n\r\nIf it turns out that it is possible to eff \"red\" from one side of a brain\'s hemisphere made of neurons, to an indistinguishable red in a hemisphere made entirely of abstracted behavior running on silicone, then this theory will be proved wrong.  We admit such as a possibility.  But we believe there will be some type of vanishing, fading, or dancing qualia, and the system will be unable to honestly answer the simple question: what is red like for you, how is it different than green, and it will not be able to give an honest answer that is functionally equivalent on a sufficiently fine grained level.\r\n\r\nWe believe this theory that nature has fundamental phenomenal properties to have significant implications for Nick Bostrom\'s Simulation Argument http://www.simulation-argument.com/.  The idea that we, along with all of our conscious awareness, can some how arise from a \"sufficiently fine grained functional isomorph\" regardless of how many levels this functional isomorph is above the basement level is problematic.  We believe to even think such is to indicate one\'s lack of understanding of the fundamental nature of phenomenal properties, and their categorical difference from mere cause and effect behavior.  We believe such an idea removes these phenomenal properties so far from hard reality that it would make them completely irrelevant and arbitrary.\r\n\r\nStathis Papaioannou says:\r\n\r\n\"My reading of Chalmers is that working out exactly what the physical basis of a particular phenomenal quality is well enough to transfer or reproduce it at will would still leave the hard problem of why there should be any phenomenal property at all associated with that particular, or any, physical system.\"\r\n\r\nWe especially agree with this within any principle of organization invariance theory.  Such does indeed seem like an impossible \"hard problem\".  However, within this competing matter has phenomenal properties theory, we instead accept that it is consistently particular matter, in a particular state, that has particular phenomenal properties, and indeed that the cause and effect behaviors our senses are indirectly observing are likely more accurately portrayed as a cause of particular phenomenal properties rather than the other way around.  Within this competing theory, not only are things less arbitrary, the why do these phenomenal properties exist is less of a problem than our lack of knowledge of why nature has particular cause and effect behavioral properties at all.  We don\'t know why force more or less equals mass times acceleration.  We just accept that it does, without asking why.  And that knowledge alone, despite how incomplete it is, is all that is needed to take us to the stars.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but phenomenal properties are much more fundamental and epistemologically absolute than all these mere cause and effect behaviors beyond our senses are.  For after all, we could be just a brain in a vat where that brain is composed of nothing more than phenomenal properties, while all this mere cause and effect behavior our senses are allegedly reporting to us, might really just only exist in some artificial matrix somewhere, at some arbitrarily distant levels above any basement reality.  At the very least, the most primal and absolute of all things is the phenomenal natures of at least part of that brain in that bucket.  I think, and that thinking is phenomenal, therefore I am at least phenomenal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2007-10-10 16:36:27','2007-10-10 16:36:27'),(16,1,73,'\r\n\r\nStathis,\r\n\r\nI knew I was still missing something.

If so I\'ll submit it without yet removing the few remaining things Michael might still be objecting to.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nName:		Consciousness is Real\r\nTitle:		Consciousness is real, representative, and a part of our brain\r\nParent:		Depends on Brain\r\n\r\nWe believe consciousness to be real, representational, and composed of phenomenal properties which are categorically different than behavioral properties.\r\n\r\nIn his book: â€œConsciousness explainedâ€ Daniel Dennett claims we donâ€™t experience qualia â€œIt just seems like we do.â€ (P 375)  But the very meaning of to seem is to have knowledge that doesn\'t accurately represent its referent making this an obvious thinking error; for we are only talking about the actual phenomenal qualities of this knowledge which really has nothing to do with whether such phenomenal qualities are misrepresenting something or not.\r\n\r\nWe believe the perception process to be based on a chain of cause and effect physical events.  There is what we are looking at, beyond our eyes, which is the initial cause of the perception process.  There is also our knowledge of what we are looking at which is the final result of the perception process entirely in our brain.  We believe this conscious knowledge to be composed of phenomenal properties.  \"Red\" is a phenomenal property in our brain that is only related to the surface of something that reflects 700nm light, only because our brain happens to use that phenomenal quality to represent it.\r\n\r\nWe think the red strawberry amongst the green leaves we are aware of is out beyond our eyes, and that we are directly aware of it.  But this is an illusion.  In reality, this knowledge is entirely in our head, in a conscious spirit world model of the reality we perceive.  At the center of this phenomenal 3D world in our brain is the knowledge of our body.  When we stub our toe, the pain is produced by the brain.  It only seems like it is in our toe, because the pain is in our knowledge of the toe in our brain, not the real toe it represents that is part of our foot.  Phantom limb pain, produced by amputees, results because our knowledge of the appendages in our brain is not amputated with the limb.\r\n\r\nInside our knowledge of our head (a spiritual head, if you will, representing and entirely contained within our real head) is a knowledge of our \"self\" or \"spirit\" or \"I\".  This \"I\" is represented as looking out of our knowledge of our eyes.  But of course, this knowledge that is our spirit, unlike most everything else in this conscious spirit world, has no referent in reality.  However, though it has no referent in reality, this in no way means it does not exist.  This phenomenal \"spirit\" is what we really and literally spiritually are.  During \"out of body experiences\" this knowledge of our spirit leaves our knowledge of our body, all in the \"spirit world\" of our conscious awareness, all in and dependent on our brain.\r\n\r\nAll this conscious knowledge is composed of ineffable phenomenal properties.  We know the difference between the green leaf and the red strawberry, precisely because of the phenomenal difference between red and green.  We believe it is absurd to think the only way to determine the nature of another intelligence or consciousness is through a \"Turing Test\".  To know such, you simply must ask a question like: \"What is Red like?\"  And in order to know the other mind isn\'t lying, you must be able to \"eff\" this phenomenal quality to the other mind by reproducing whatever it is in the original mind that has this same quality.  This effing would be similar to the way we can know the difference between red represented in the left hemisphere of our brain and green represented in the right hemisphere of our brain.  Once the taste of salt is effed to another mind, whether this mind be natural or artificial, the response will be something like: \"Oh THAT is what salt tastes like.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe science is on the verge of getting an objective handle on these phenomenal properties finally resolving how they work and many other conundrums of self and epistemology philosophy has been struggling with for so long.  We believe such a discovery will be the most significant, profound and world changing of scientific achievements to date.  For such a discovery will be the literal piercing of this ineffable spiritual veil, that can be thought of as our skull, spiritually freeing us from this isolated, lonely, mortal prison, out into a shared subjective physical world that surely must be much more than just \"behavior\".\r\n\r\nThis theory makes profound predictions about what things like uploading and \"escaping from our mortal spirit prison\" will be like, should it turn out to be true.  A detailed description of such predictions is contained in chapters 5 and 6 of the short story by Brent Allsop entitled \"1229 years after Titanic\" available here: http://home.comcast.net/~brent.allsop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nName:		Arises from Anything\r\nTitle:		Consciousness arises from equivalent abstract physical behavior\r\nParent:		Consciousness is Real\r\n\r\nIn 1995, David Chalmers authored another popular paper describing a \"Principle of organizational invariance\" http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html.  In it he argues that the implausibility of fading or dancing qualia make a convincing argument that it is more likely that these phenomenal properties will some how \"arise\" from whatever physical mater is abstractly behaving like the neurons that are responsible for the same.  He admits that it is difficult to imagine how such diverse things as a set of water pipes or set of wind machines could possibly result in such phenomenal properties, but concludes with:\r\n\r\n\"I conclude that by far the most plausible hypothesis is that replacement of neurons while preserving functional organization will preserve qualia, and that experience is wholly determined by functional organization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis camp will be a rewrite of the existing camp with the same name.\r\nThe parent will be changed to be the new \"Consciousness is Real\" camp and thereby be a competitor to Chalmer\'s \"Arises from Anything or \"Principle of organizational invariance\" camp.\r\nName:		Phenomenal Properties\r\nTitle:		Nature Has Ineffable Phenomenal Properties\r\nParent:		Depends on Brain\r\n\r\nWe believe David Chalmers is pushing in the wrong direction in his effort to get a handle on this \"hard problem\", and that the \"Principle of organizational invariance\" will turn out to be wrong.\r\n\r\nDavid Chalmers, and others that talk about this hard problem often use the term \"physical process\" to refer to what physical science tells us about the stuff our brain is made of, and its causes and effects.  They contrast this with the subjective nature of our ideas.  More often than not, terms like the following are used to relate the two: \"arise from\", \"neural correlate\", \"results in\", \"causes\", \"supervenes on\" and so on.  We believe all such to be a mistaken terminology leading us away from reality.\r\n\r\nWe believe the fundamental critical difference, should instead be only focused on the cause and effect behavior, on the scientifically observable side, and the phenomenal qualities on the subjective side.  Certainly whatever these are must both be included as physical properties of the universe since the universe, by definition includes all that can be observed and experienced.  To say \"physical process gives rise to the subjective\" is to fail to clearly distinguish between what is really important and the fact that it is all included in the \"physical\".\r\n\r\nWe believe that evolution has managed to use something that has a red phenomenal property to represent knowledge of something that reflects 700 nm light, while using something different that has the phenomenal different property, green, to distinguish between and be aware of a different item that reflects 500 nm light.  But when we use cause and effect observation techniques to observe whatever it is our brain is using the phenomenal properties of to represent knowledge, certainly we shouldn\'t expect them to reflect 700 and 500 nm light and so on right?\r\n\r\nAny causally downstream effect can represent its upstream referent.  We might say it can be behaviorally or abstractly \"like\" it. While at the same time the more important and more primal phenomenal quality is lost, and the downstream effect is nothing phenomenally \"like\" it.  This is precisely the meaning of \"ineffable\" and why traditional cause and effect observation can\'t see them, or rather can only see their behavioral effects.\r\n\r\nYet when there is a juicy sweet strawberry in our left field of vision, represented by red in our right hemisphere, we are clearly aware of this because of its difference between whatever it is in our left hemisphere that has a green phenomenal property representing our knowledge of the leaves in our right field of vision.  In this way our conscious world is unified, and we are able to \"eff\" the primal phenomenal difference between them\r\n\r\nPhysical sciences have classified natural elements into the periodic table.  We know, abstractly, much about the behavior of these individual elements consistently across space, time, temperature, and so on.  We believe we will also find phenomenal properties that equally consistently across space and time map into this table.  This is why we believe Chalmers is critically mistaken when he claims anything with a fundamental nature like \"red\" can \"arise\" from anything as diverse as a properly configured set of water pipes.\r\n\r\nOnce we learn the process where these phenomenal properties can be unified together into a single world of conscious awareness across multiple hemispheres of our brain, and across time, we will also find ways to share or eff these phenomenal properties between multiple brains, and indeed be able to have our spiritual knowledge escape the ineffable spirit prison walls that are our skulls and discover much more than just the behavior of the elements in this table that make up the spiritual, if you will, universe.\r\n\r\nChalmers uses Hans Moravec\'s \"Transmigration\" http://www.leaderu.com/truth/2truth05.html thought experiment to make what many take as a powerful argument for the principle of organizational invariance.  You start replacing all the relevant neurons with abstracted silicone counterparts.  When you start you have David Chalmers.  \"The final system, Robot, is in the same situation, processing the same inputs and producing similar behavior, but by hypothesis is experiencing nothing at all.\"\r\n which obviously could not be accurate at all.\r\n\r\nThere must be something in the robots functionally equivalent mind that is the robots knowledge of the strawberry that is distinguishable from something that is the leaves.  One possibility could be a set of ones for red, and a set of zeros for green.  So when we ask the robot what red is like, it says (if it is not programmed to lie) it must describe its awareness of red as 1, and its awareness of green to be 0, or whatever abstracted non phenomenal difference achieves the functionally equivalent behavior.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis is that whatever it is that has this red property in the system of awareness, when replaced, will be unable to present the same red to the system of unified conscious awareness.  Though the behavior could be modeled by using something like abstracted ones and zeros, and perhaps a slightly more complex system to use a lookup table to lie about it being aware of differing red and green phenomenal properties.  But certainly any such lying system would in no way be a functionally isomorphic system.  And since the primal and phenomenal nature of red and green, and their difference, could not be presented to such a system of unified awareness, when whatever is producing the spot of red is replaced by the silicone equivalent, there must be some kind of vanishing or dancing qualia on that spot of the strawberry in our conscious world of awareness.\r\n\r\nIf it turns out that it is possible to eff \"red\" from one side of a brain\'s hemisphere made of neurons, to an indistinguishable red in a hemisphere made entirely of abstracted behavior running on silicone, then this theory will be proved wrong.  We admit such as a possibility.  But we believe there will be some type of vanishing, fading, or dancing qualia, and the system will be unable to honestly answer the simple question: what is red like for you, how is it different than green, and it will not be able to give an honest answer that is functionally equivalent on a sufficiently fine grained level.\r\n\r\nWe believe this theory that nature has fundamental phenomenal properties to have significant implications for Nick Bostrom\'s Simulation Argument http://www.simulation-argument.com/.  The idea that we, along with all of our conscious awareness, can some how arise from a \"sufficiently fine grained functional isomorph\" regardless of how many levels this functional isomorph is above the basement level is problematic.  We believe to even think such is to indicate one\'s lack of understanding of the fundamental nature of phenomenal properties, and their categorical difference from mere cause and effect behavior.  We believe such an idea removes these phenomenal properties so far from hard reality that it would make them completely irrelevant and arbitrary.\r\n\r\nStathis Papaioannou says:\r\n\r\n\"My reading of Chalmers is that working out exactly what the physical basis of a particular phenomenal quality is well enough to transfer or reproduce it at will would still leave the hard problem of why there should be any phenomenal property at all associated with that particular, or any, physical system.\"\r\n\r\nWe especially agree with this within any principle of organization invariance theory.  Such does indeed seem like an impossible \"hard problem\".  However, within this competing matter has phenomenal properties theory, we instead accept that it is consistently particular matter, in a particular state, that has particular phenomenal properties, and indeed that the cause and effect behaviors our senses are indirectly observing are likely more accurately portrayed as a cause of particular phenomenal properties rather than the other way around.  Within this competing theory, not only are things less arbitrary, the why do these phenomenal properties exist is less of a problem than our lack of knowledge of why nature has particular cause and effect behavioral properties at all.  We don\'t know why force more or less equals mass times acceleration.  We just accept that it does, without asking why.  And that knowledge alone, despite how incomplete it is, is all that is needed to take us to the stars.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but phenomenal properties are much more fundamental and epistemologically absolute than all these mere cause and effect behaviors beyond our senses are.  For after all, we could be just a brain in a vat where that brain is composed of nothing more than phenomenal properties, while all this mere cause and effect behavior our senses are allegedly reporting to us, might really just only exist in some artificial matrix somewhere, at some arbitrarily distant levels above any basement reality.  At the very least, the most primal and absolute of all things is the phenomenal natures of at least part of that brain in that bucket.  I think, and that thinking is phenomenal, therefore I am at least phenomenal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2007-10-10 16:36:27','2007-10-10 16:36:27'),(17,1,1,'Brent,\r\n\r\nI would support the new \"Consciousness is Real\" camp in its final version.

John Searle also claims that only a biological brain can have phenomenal consciousness, but there is a crucial difference between the two positions: Searle thinks that a computer could perfectly emulate the behaviour of a brain while lacking phenomenal consciousness (weak AI is possible but not strong AI) while Penrose does not believe a computer could ever achieve even this feat (neither strong nor weak AI is possible). What Chalmers shows in the cited paper is that Searle cannot be right: a neural isomorph that behaves exactly like the original neuron would have to also replicate the phenomenal consciousness. If it did not, then you would experience something like fading qualia, and unless you were somehow prevented from reporting this, your behaviour would differ, which would mean that it wouldn\'t be a perfect neural isomorph. So it is quite possible that the qualia would fade, but the only way this could happen is if the behaviour of the neuron could not be replicated by a computer, as Penrose proposes. \r\n\r\nPenrose\'s position is thus shown to be internally consistent, while Searle\'s is not. The problem is, few people accept Penrose\'s argument from Godel\'s theorem purporting to show that the brain can do non-computable things, or his suggestion that fundamentally non-computable physics in the microtubules is at the basis of this effect. There seems to be no good reason to suppose that neural activity is not Turing emulable, and in that case, phenomenal consciousness has to be emulable into the bargain.\r\n\r\nBTW, is there an easier way to quote when replying in these forums than cutting and pasting from another browser window?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStathis Papaioannou\r\n\r\n\r\n','2007-10-12 12:02:56','2007-10-12 12:02:56'),(18,1,73,'Brent,\r\n\r\nI would support the new \"Consciousness is Real\" camp in its final version.

I was the original author of this camp, but did it in an attempt to be \"sympathetic\" to this different than my POV (I am in the competing phenomenal properties camp here:  http://test.canonizer.com/topic.asp/23/2) I\'m sure I didn\'t do a very good job naming and describing your camp and such.\r\n\r\nA camp that has no supporters, can be changed by anyone, at any time, in any way.  And no supporters basically means no one believes that.  But now that you are supporting this camp, you will be automatically notified of any proposed changes to the camp, and you will be able to object to any such proposed changes during the 1 week review period before it \"goes live\".  For as long as you are the only supporter of this camp, you can make any changes you would like, to this camp, and your changes will go live instantly.  You can change the name, text, or anything.  Once others join, changes become more difficult since all changes must be agreed on unanimously by all supporters.\r\n\r\nWe apologize for not having any real documentation on how to do all this yet.  If you know anyone that is interested in donating a few hours of time helping with such, or anything, in exchange for some shares of Canonizer LLC that would be great.  (we believe this to be a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of the next big thing on the internet, see http://test.canonizer.com/topic.asp/4 for more details and disclaimers.)\r\n\r\nAnd of course us atheists are also always happy to have another member of our camp.\r\n\r\nWelcome aboard.\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop','2007-10-20 15:43:37','2007-10-20 15:43:37'),(24,1,78,'richwil,\r\n\r\nI believe Chalmers will not agree with this camp as it exists on 07/10/20.\r\n\r\nI believe you are making a categorical error. It seems to me that you clearly simply do not understand the hard problem, or the nature of phenomenal properties and how they are different than behavioral properties.\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with one kind of matter being unable to behave like another, such as a feather behaving like a piece of led or whatever. If you have a set of water pipes configured so it can be a Turing machine, you can theoretically (of course not practically, but to worry about such is to completely miss what Chalmers is talking about) simulate a reality which can contain items that do behave precisely like fissile material, or any other material you want - to the degree that you could not tell the simulated behavior running on water pipes, from the real. I bet that Chalmers would claim that such a virtual brain, being simulated on water pipes, would be sufficiently functionally equivalent as to cause phenomenal properties to \"rise\" in some incomprehensibly hard way.\r\n\r\nBut then, I\'m in a different camp from both of you, and that is just me. And I don\'t really know what camp Chalmers will end up in. Either way, we are happy to have your camp represented and supported in the Canonizer. The more diverse the POV the better right!? At least until science forces us to all join \"The One\" camp and the theory rises to the agreement statement and is thereby finally fact.\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop ','2007-10-21 05:06:11','2007-10-21 05:06:11'),(25,1,78,'Brent\r\n\r\nA category error?\r\n\r\nThe hard problem is how consciousness arises from brain.

Pipes and people could form a Turing machine, computing what the replaced neuron would do, and then could in theory control appropriate effectors - electrical fields, chemical messengers, or some exotic nanotech that takes hold of the neighbouring neurons\' receptors and tweaks them in the same way the original neuron would have done. But this special behaviour is only necessary at the interface between the replaced neurons and the original neurons. At the limit of the thought experiment, we would have gradually replaced all the neurons but one with functional equivalent; and then, we replace that final neuron and have no more need for the biological/cybernetic interface, assuming sensory organs and muscles have also been replaced with durable cybernetic versions. Thus, the final result just requires that the robot behave in a functionally identical way to the original, and that it get to this state in a way consistent with gradual functional replacement in the intermediate steps.','2007-10-21 13:48:57','2007-10-21 13:48:57'),(27,1,78,'\r\nrichwil,\r\n\r\nI\'ve been working with Stathis for some time now, on this, and I thought I had him figured out.  I have definitely come to highly respect his brilliant grasp on many topics, especially this one.  I assumed (obviously, incorrectly) that I could reform my camp, and get Stathis to join my camp, to stand as a majority over your camp.  So I got way to cocky, I sent him an e-mail informing him of my intentions, and once he saw that, he went and joined your camp!  So now it is your camp that is towering above all the rest of our camps with only one supporter at this level.\r\n\r\nSo I must say congratulations to you and your camp.  I\'ve got to seriously reconsider and think about things now.  Man I love diversity of opinion, it is always so surprising.\r\n\r\nBut don\'t make the same mistake I did, and get to over confident.

On each camp statement page, including the agreement statement at the top, there is an \'Add New Position Statement Under \"<statement name>\" statement\' link.  This is where you create a statement on a topic, under the current statement, as apposed to an entirely new topic.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?  Is that the best way to do things?  Once you create the new parallel camp, I can always delete the old topic if you want.  Or I can do anything else you\'d like, just let me know.

However, my view is the result of a long struggle to get beyond the usual dualism/monism debate and out the other side to safe ground. It entails a radical, but by no means new, approach. It think it is the view that Leibniz held, although I cannot be sure. It seems to be common amongst modern physicists, but they tend not to like to talk metaphysics and often seem to drop into inconsistencies when considering the human mind. Let me add some comments;\r\n\r\nFirstly, I agree that Chalmers ran into trouble in 1996, having identified some important issues but then taken the wrong way out (particularly his invariance principle).\r\n\r\nYou distinguish \'behaviour on the scientifically observable side\' with the phenomenal. For me this is only half way to the true dichotomy or complementarity. The phenomenal is in contrast to, and complemented by, a dynamic account which itself has no appearance or imaginable form - such as Maxwell\'s or Schrodinger\'s equations. However, in order to talk about the relation between the dynamic account and the phenomenal we have to set up ontologically bogus accounts of the world, variously describable as geometric, kinematic, or historic accounts. We tend to think there is one consistent \'physical\' account of this sort but there is an infinite variety of these hybrids. In general terms the dynamic and the geometric differ in that the dynamic is an account of potentialities (which becomes crucial for quantum theory) and the geometric is an account of actualities, treated as observed, even if only by proxy. The geometric account differs chiefly from the experiential in being a \'third person objective\' account rather than a first person experiential account. However, these rules get bent in all sorts of ways.\r\n\r\nScience has always used two accounts - an observational account and a dynamic account which predicts what the observational account should be. Science is about testing hypotheses and so always relates the potential to the actual. There never was one sort of account. What few people realise is that the potential and actual are fundamentally incompatible. For instance there is no now in the potential account. It might seem that we should compare the potential dynamic account with the experiential but to be any use to a community we have to use agreed geometric accounts. Moreover, the experiential account plays tricks, which we want to iron out. The experience of time, for instance, cannot be what it seems to be, so we need to \'sanitise\' it.\r\n\r\nI agree that a phenomenal sense of red is not going to come out of pipes. I am a bit doubtful about invoking the periodic table since I suspect phenomenal properties relate to physical entities at a much bigger level than the chemical. Moreover phenomenal properties always relate to observations, which are interactions, events, or Whitehead\'s \'actual occasions\'. Things cannot have phenomenal properties as isolated things, but only through their interactions with other elements of the universe.\r\n\r\nYou talk of unification of phenomenal properties into a single consciousness across two hemispheres, yet I know of very few people who overtly suggest this occurs, nor seen any evidence that it does. Descartes suggested that the pineal was the seat of consciousness because he realised that it made no sense for it to spread across both hemispheres. For me (like WIlliam James) no theory has ever been proposed that begins to make sense of such an idea so I see it as no more than lay folklore.  I agree with James that the only explanation of consciousness which is not self contradictory is that each cell is aware separately. People find this idea unfamiliar and hard to take, but it goes back centuries and has the bonus that is resolves many paradoxes. The fading qualia story is no problem since each time you replace a cell you lose that awareness, but the others remain the same.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that quantum theory \'shows that these (dynamic) rules cannot have any sort of reality with an appearance\' I am simply referring to the fact that the dynamic account in quantum theory defies any \'geometric\' or experiential account. There is no meaning to the question \'where is a photon halfway from its source to its point of absorption\'. It has no halfway existence separate from its total existence, nor any position at any specific time. We simply cannot think of a mental image that corresponds to this. This is in itself not a big issue because Leibniz knew for reasons of fundamental logic that the dynamic account of the world cannot have any appearance. Moreover, modern neuropsychology shows that our experiential account of the world is a contrived mock up that cannot possibly have a direct relation to the dynamic account. And at the end of the day it is simply illogical to think that the rules that determine appearances should have appearances. Quantum theory simply gives us no way to wriggle out.\r\n\r\nIn summary I would say that your statement sounds a fairly traditional dual aspect monism or property dualism in which things have \'physical\' and phenomenal aspects. My approach is very different in that there are no things. There are experiences and dynamic rules which determine those experiences. There are further levels to the analysis which may bring it back closer to things, I admit. An experience in my current model belongs to an instance of operation of the rules (operating on, or interacting with an environment) , so that the instance becomes almost a thing but not in the lay sense.\r\n\r\nFor anyone interested further I recommend Bilodeau, D. (1996) Journal of Consciousness Studies 1996, 3, (5-6), 386-401. as an introduction to the dynamic approach. I think things need taking further and have found agreement with Henry Stapp on this,  in terms of the potential/actual complementarity. My short book \'How Many People Are There in My Head? And in Hers?\' (Imprint Academic or Amazon) gives the whole story although things have moved on a bit. My next article for Journal of Consciousness Studies - \"Are our spaces made of words\" should appear in the New Year. An earlier article touching on these issues is at my website (Google; Jonathan Edwards UCL).\r\n\r\nWith best wishes\r\n\r\nJo\r\n','2007-10-28 17:24:14','2007-10-28 17:24:14'),(32,1,1,'\r\nFolks,\r\n\r\nSorry about that last version.\r\nWe\'re debugging this as we go.\r\nThis version should be better.\r\n\r\nThe initial version of the Agreement Statement text was just a kind of temporary version to get things started.

Nothing in these accounts *has* an appearance; but their function is to *predict* appearances. The distinction is simple, crucial, but rarely understood.\r\n\r\nGeometric accounts are tricks we use to reassure ourselves that our dynamic accounts are valid. We imagine that a ball thrown in the air forms a series of â€˜stillsâ€™ with the ball in different places and that we can also do a â€˜time-lapseâ€™ which shows the ball having a â€˜pathâ€™ which is a parabola. We can use these accounts to check dynamics because our brains carry unconscious machinery which is capable of checking these stills and time-lapses (with unbelievable accuracy for sportsmen and musicians) and giving us the feeling â€˜yup, thatâ€™s how it isâ€™. Of course before Galileo the machinery sometimes said something different â€“ which shows that it is programmed by schoolroom learning as well as experience.\r\n\r\nExperiential accounts are just experience â€“ seeing a ball. (The space we see the ball in is quite different from the space metric of the dynamic rules. They might seem the same but if you consider them carefully you find glaring incompatibilities.)

What is more difficult is dealing with the many hybrid, bridging, generally geometric accounts. The endless debate over interpretations of quantum theory is really just a failure to understand the mess you get into if you do not see these accounts for what they are.\r\n\r\nWhen I say fading qualia is not problem I mean that each time you replace a cell you replace an entire experience of the world. This has nothing to do with a spot on a strawberry. I am not sure why you put cell in scare quotes. Cells are biological realities: nothing else. The idea that each cell deals with a separate piece of the picture is as far as I am aware baseless and would serve no computational purpose. The whole point of having cells where many inputs come together to generate an output is that they handle *many* bits of data. What would be the point of a cell handling just â€˜one red spotâ€™. \r\n \r\nIf red was in the left hemisphere and green in the right then nothing would have the experience of both, because nothing can be in both places at once. Nothing in any known computational system can have access to signals in two different places. Whatever things in our heads are aware of red and green, they have to be single receiving units so cannot be in both hemispheres. What seems so sad is that this was clear to people in the seventeenth century and widely discussed in the nineteenth but now we seem to be back to a medieval view. Something or somethings in my head is/are aware of both red and green. The medieval view is that there is only one such something and it is me or my soul. Since Leibnizâ€™s time it has been clear that this assumption has no rational basis, and wonâ€™t work.\r\n\r\nThis relates to Stathisâ€™s point. There is often confusion between the two meanings of unified. Unification can mean â€˜joining togetherâ€™ in some way. It can also mean â€˜creating a single thingâ€™. A publisher unifies pages into a book but that does not mean there is only one copy of the book. We all agree that our experiences seem to be all together, although it is not clear what the alternative would be. On the other hand, we have no evidence to support the idea that there is only one copy of such an experience in a head at one time. We have no reason to think that there is only one subject or â€˜meâ€™ in this sense. This comes as a surprise to people, but it has been discussed for centuries and neuroscience now makes it highly unlikely that there is a single subject â€˜meâ€™ in a brain. Biological systems do not work like that, for good survival reasons.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy for non-neuroscientists to assume that neuroscience is steadily working towards an account of a single subject spanning both hemispheres. However, I doubt you will find anything in the conventional neuroscience literature that actually proposes a viable hypothesis along these lines. The only proposals I am aware of are â€˜fringeâ€™ science accounts which may be courageous and interestingly wrong but which I suspect would have been picked to pieces in a few minutes in academic circles in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nI am afraid to say that to become a student of consciousness one has to read the historical literature, as in any subject. One cannot just work with intuitions. Things have crashed because twentieth century neurologists never got taught any basic metaphysics (in the sense of the word that Newton and Leibniz used). Probably the best account of all the background issues is William James\'s Principles of Psychology (1890). However, as he admits, James bottles out of a solution (twice) so you have to draw your own conclusions.

Something or somethings in my head is/are aware of both red and green. The medieval view is that there is only one such something and it is me or my soul. Since Leibnizâ€™s time it has been clear that this assumption has no rational basis, and wonâ€™t work.\r\n\r\nThis relates to Stathisâ€™s point. There is often confusion between the two meanings of unified. Unification can mean â€˜joining togetherâ€™ in some way. It can also mean â€˜creating a single thingâ€™. A publisher unifies pages into a book but that does not mean there is only one copy of the book. We all agree that our experiences seem to be all together, although it is not clear what the alternative would be. On the other hand, we have no evidence to support the idea that there is only one copy of such an experience in a head at one time. We have no reason to think that there is only one subject or â€˜meâ€™ in this sense. This comes as a surprise to people, but it has been discussed for centuries and neuroscience now makes it highly unlikely that there is a single subject â€˜meâ€™ in a brain. Biological systems do not work like that, for good survival reasons.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy for non-neuroscientists to assume that neuroscience is steadily working towards an account of a single subject spanning both hemispheres. However, I doubt you will find anything in the conventional neuroscience literature that actually proposes a viable hypothesis along these lines. The only proposals I am aware of are â€˜fringeâ€™ science accounts which may be courageous and interestingly wrong but which I suspect would have been picked to pieces in a few minutes in academic circles in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nI am afraid to say that to become a student of consciousness one has to read the historical literature, as in any subject. One cannot just work with intuitions. Things have crashed because twentieth century neurologists never got taught any basic metaphysics (in the sense of the word that Newton and Leibniz used). Probably the best account of all the background issues is William James\'s Principles of Psychology (1890). However, as he admits, James bottles out of a solution (twice) so you have to draw your own conclusions. If you want my conclusion try my book (it will come up on Google/Amazon) - it is short and sweet as these books go.','2007-11-12 08:44:30','2007-11-12 08:44:30'),(54,1,1,'Jo,\r\n\r\nThank-you for your detailed post.

That is why we didn\'t use a simple talk or \"discussion\" page like wikipedia uses for its articles.  This kind of extensive debate can happen here, in another notes group, or for that matter, in the vestibule of a church with your bishop.  But to me, the important thing is that once you have had such a debate, you summarize and concisely state what was covered after it is all over.  And the POV camp statements are the place for this.  If it ends up that you agree, you will both be in the same camp, if it ends up that you disagree, you will both enter and support two sibling competing camps.  And the next time the issue comes up when someone new comes on the set, everyone can quickly get up to speed and make some real progress.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a concise summary, and a repository for such, this can give all debates some formal structure, memory, and a real goal to focus on - i.e. the final concise statements of belief.  A similar thing occurs with peer review journals, but that is just way to hard, slow, and ivory tower based to be able to make any quick progress on things as new scientific data is streaming at us so fast.  And the worst part, it is impossible to get any idea of how many people are in any particular camp, or want things a certain way.  How do you know if you are reading just another crappy peer reviewed article in some Psyche journal, or one that everyone agrees could dramatically change the thinking on all this?  Without such polling or Canonizing ability we all end up using our own terminology our own way which ends up being a huge mess for everyone and no one can communicate.\r\n\r\nFor example, it seems to me that Jo is using some terminology here that I think is very misleading and even mistaken for me and my world, and this is why I couldn\'t initially understand what he was saying.\r\n\r\nJo had to finally say:\r\n\r\n\"Dynamic accounts of space and time are the applications of rules that predict observations, such as: Newton\'s F=ma or s=vt or Schrodinger\'s equation. Nothing in these accounts *has* an appearance; but their function is to *predict* appearances. The distinction is simple, crucial, but rarely understood.\"\r\n\r\nFor me, a better term than \"Dynamic accounts\" would just be \"abstracted model\".  And the usage of \"appearance\" is just completely confusing to me because appearance could involve the entire complex and controversial perception process.  At first I\'m thinking, Is he talking about how our knowledge in our brain of something we are apprehending is?  Or maybe the way the surface of something reflects 700 nm light at the other end of the perception process?\"  After Jo further explained things, I finally translated this into what I consider a much better way to say it which is that an appearance is just a physical insanitation or real example of what the model or abstracted theory represents (regardless of how accurate the particular abstract model is.).\r\n\r\nJo, have I successfully translated your terminology into mine?  Or am I still missing something important?\r\n\r\nOf course, I likely use my terminology because of my computer background which always uses terms like abstract models and instantiations of such.  While Jo is obviously very educated in the history of all this and many other things, which I am completely ignorant of.

They are saints too, and I think our goal, is to find the least and most lonely of these, declare them also saints, find out what they want, and do all in our power to get what they want along with the rest of us. They don\'t need to be forgiven, they should be worshiped.  The new kind of canonization, to me, is all about not telling people what to read, want, or believe, and threatening them with eternal damnation otherwise, but asking everyone what they want, the more diversity the better, canonizing all this, and then having as our (or the Canonizer\'s) goal doing all in our power to get it all for everyone having eternal faith that some day it might all be possible.

Where we\'re talking about matters of opinion, as opposed to matters of fact, what else do we have to go on but sheer numbers?

I think I\'m just not expressing things properly, so need to know how to say things better so it doesn\'t portray things inaccurately.\r\n\r\nA personal value of mine is to think that mankind will some day, technologically, find a cure for aging and stuff and make themselves immortal.  But just because I believe that, doesn\'t mean I go around wasting my time on futile things we\'re obviously still a long way from being able to accomplish.  There are clearly a lot of people still dying of AIDS and hunger, and we\'ve got to work on things like that as a higher priority first.  But still, just the idea that these kinds of amazing things are a possibility, even if only in the distant and currently not relevant future, has an effect on the way one lives there life (and the way an organization operates.)\r\n\r\nI think charitable organizations should always be grass roots based, not forced from above by governments.  The biggest problem with that is grass roots based organizations have a hard time being managed and organized.  I see the Canonizer as a possible solution to this.  It will allow people that want to do similar kinds of charity work to work together much more cooperatively and effectively.  So if you have a quantitatively measured huge group of people willing to donate, together, known sums of capital, the canonizer will effectively be directing how that capital will be used.  So will not, getting people with aids what they want, a cure like this, and things like that be classified in the purpose of the Canonizer?  Of course, right now, that is very irrelevant and even meaningless, as far as our daily plans and immediate tactics go.  But it is those kinds of long term goals that helps drive me and gives much more meaning to trying to get this RAID disk, and so on, to work.\r\n\r\nAlso, another very long term goal of mine, is to get something like the Canonizer, perhaps on $100 per laptop like systems, into very poor countries, and countries like Iraq, North Korea, and so on.  Everyone knows what the individual war mongering kings, presidents, ayatollahs, military leaders and prophets want, but is anyone asking the entrepreneurial 20 somethings of those countries what they want?  Everyone in the US, knows what president bush and our talking head pundits wants, but nobody has the slightest clue what the Iraqi people want.  Isn\'t there something hugely immoral about things like that?  I bet IF the people of the US had a way to really concisely and quantitatively know what the people of Iraqi wanted, there would be nothing that could stand in the way of the US people helping these Iraqi people get precisely that.\r\n\r\nRight now, there is a terrible self destructive situation in Iraq.  Any Iraq stepping up to cooperate with the US, even if they don\'t like the US, is seen as a traitor.  What we need, is some way to get help to such people willing to step up, that isn\'t \"biased\" as all such \"military\" help is today.  My dream is to have people donate charitable capital controlled by the Canonizer, and then have capital 100% controlled and directed by the Iraqi people, or whoever based on a selected canonizer, with no influence whatsoever from the people providing the capital.\r\n\r\nI think the charity work being done by the likes of Bill Gates is great, but he is obviously deciding how all the money is spent.  And to me, that is the immoral part.  There should be some way to get money to the people at the bottom, that is completely under their control.  Do they want a cure for aids?  Or do they just want a sewer system and set of schools in their town that works much more immediately, then they can work on AIDSâ€¦?\r\n\r\nAnd even, immediately, the idea of getting everyone what they want effects everything we do here.  The whole structure of the Canonizer system is designed so that everyone can get what they want, no matter how diverse their POV, into the system.  Trying to find creative ways to get it all for everyone should be our fundamental driving ideology, I think.\r\n\r\nSo help me know how to say these kinds of things in ways that still indicates that, for the time being, they don\'t have much to do with what we are working on now or our immediate short term goals.  Isn\'t all this kind of market \"distortion\" what really drives (or should really drive) all economics and commercial ventures?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n','2007-11-29 15:43:48','2007-11-29 15:43:48'),(122,1,56,'Brent,\r\n\r\nI wish there was a half-decent quoting mechanism, though I realise there are higher priorities.\r\n\r\nYou\'re a highly idealistic guy, and you\'re working hard to put your ideals into practice, which I very much respect.

I can\'t share it to the same extent -- I might have said \"extreme\" there -- but I\'m definitely less inclined to criticise now. I might even withdraw my support from \"the consiliator\"! For a little while I was thinking about arguing for an option to switch off quantification, but I\'m less inclined to do that now. I still think that, for some purposes, where the ideas are all that really matter, that option would be good, but of course all such suggestions have to be prioritised.\r\n\r\nI\'d say, as far as public pronouncements are concerned, focus on the more obvious and down-to-earth benefits of a pov wiki. They\'re relatively easy to understand and to accept. Once the system is properly up-and-running, you can start experimenting with more ambitious applications.\r\n\r\nI wish I had the time to be involved at a practical level, but I don\'t. Between my philosophy, earning a living, and getting some R&R, I\'m all tied up. I believe I will withdraw my support for consilience, and step back a bit, but I\'ll stay on the developers list for now and will, of course, remain engaged with the Hard Problem.','2007-11-29 19:49:32','2007-11-29 19:49:32'),(123,188,18,'Michael,\r\n\r\nI highly value your POV being expressed and supported in the Canonizer on this Unfriendly AI issue.

It\'s the total light impinging on each of those lens\' surface points that is focused collectively on the retina as a corresponding pixel matrix corresponding to the objective object image matrix... To be sent through the optical nerve crossover network from each eye, to both the right and left hemispheres of the brain... \r\n\r\nThere. to be processed electrochemically at different neural sections of the visual cortex, and transformed through the local neural EM fields to the overall brain wave (EM) field (detected by EEG) -- where the image is assembled holographically as wave interference patterns... That are then transmitted to the higher order mind-memory fields by a phase conjugate adaptive resonance process.   \r\n\r\nThe image, now modulated in and carried by the ZPE mind field, is then detected, by reflection of its projected coherent zero-point radiation (that also reconstructs the hologram) by the consciously aware zero-point origin of the brain field located in the pineal region in the center of the head between the eyes and the ears. To be globally perceived, considered, understood, reacted to, etc. by the *entangled* self reflective consciousness located in the center of the body.  This center guides and controls, by intentionally or instinctively directed will transmitted through the neural processing system, the saccades and other aspects of attentive or inattentive consciousness.   \r\n\r\nAll this is quite intricate in practice...  But, from a communication engineering point of view, the overall process is as simple and direct as a live TV network camera- transmitter-receiver system.  Apparently, nature\'s processes are even more parsimonious than we are when we try to technologically emulate them. ;-)\r\n\r\nBA: Also, are you saying that when you perceive pain in your toe, that the\r\npain is inded in your toe? In other words, your theory is not\r\nrepresentational, if it were, you would instead say the pain was in\r\nyour representation of your toe, all in your brain. \r\nAnd you mention the \"center of our head\" and the \"center of our body\"\r\nare these the same? \r\nLM: No, the center our body refers to the chakra point of global self reflected (I am) consciousness located at the naval -- the true center of origin of the entire physical body form and its surrounding higher order hyperspace fields of consciousness, that are analogous to the initial fields of cosmogenesis.  \r\n\r\nSince I postulate that consciousness (i.e., awareness, perception, will, etc) are the qualities of each zero-point linked to each ZPE field carrying the sensory information at the point of trauma -- the experience of pain, and its reactive response is certainly in the zero-point linked to the cellular source of the pain information, and not experienced in the brain.  \r\n\r\nThus, by phase conjugate resonance of the 3-D physical body hologram mapped in the brain field of the kinesthetic cortex (and transmitted to the Astral field) with the actual physical body fields whose zero-point centers are coadunate or entangled with the neuromuscular field centers, we can graphically locate and scratch an itch on the skin.  We can also similarly place any part of our body exactly in any 3D location in the outer world field that corresponds to the visual image field, instantaneously, without any computational analysis. \r\n\r\nIn this model, the brain is solely the transponder/transformer between the sensory information and the overall field of memory and mind that is directly accessible to the primary self-referenced global consciousness center located at the naval chakra point in the center of our overall body field (the spiritual \"aura\" in Eastern philosophies).  See the last illustration of the human figure in the camp statement) \r\n\r\nIn essence, the only representational aspect in this model is the representation of the sensory and memory image information in the higher order ZPE fields that are directly accessible to their conscious zero-points of origin.  The brain, itself, is simply the intermediate processor-transformer-channeler mechanism between these mind-memory fields and the sensory sources of the information or contents of consciousness.   \r\n\r\nThank you for your perceptive questions that enable me to further clarify the ABC cosmogenetic field model.

Here\'s my story in brief.\r\n\r\nI was born into the LDS church, and although I secretly harbored gay feelings, I suppressed my attraction to men for about 35 years of my life.  During that time, I went to church, went to the temple, went on a mission, went to BYU, and married in the temple.\r\n\r\nWhen I married, all of my 7 siblings could be there, since they had all already married in the temple.  So none of them was excluded from attending.  I was a true believing mormon then, and my (now) ex-wife and I decided to raise our 2 children in mormonism.\r\n\r\nSince then, I have awakened to the untruthfulness of the LDS church, and also to my true sexual identity.\r\n\r\nBut my children remain active LDS members.  One, my son, has already married, in the LDS temple, without me.  Although he was sympathetic, he told me through actions and words, that his higher allegiance was to the church.  I can still recall the heartache I felt as I drove around Provo, on the morning of his wedding, alone, and crying.\r\n\r\nMy daughter is still unmarried, but has also said that she will marry in the temple, when the time comes.  She thought I might be a bit more comfortable if, after the actual temple ceremony, they have a \"ring ceremony\" in which I could be involved.  That\'s sweet, but it\'s not the same as being at her actual wedding, and walking her down the aisle.\r\n\r\nI wish she would have a real wedding, at which ALL could celebrate her happiness and new life,  If that happened, I don\'t believe I\'d be \"giving her away\" but I would be giving public approval of my daughter\'s choice in marrying her fiance, and it would be a chance to give her a blessing for happiness and love in her married life.\r\n\r\nBut I won\'t be able to do that, unless the LDS church changes the unfair \"doctrine\" of exclusivity now in place.\r\n\r\nMy fondest dream would be that they do so, before my daughter gets married.  Although she\'s not engaged, she has a steady boyfriend, and it looks like they\'re headed toward a commitment.\r\n\r\nNot only will the LDS church NOT allow me to attend my own and only daughter\'s wedding, they are also seeking to prevent me from marrying the adult consenting person I love.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I don\'t have very many good feelings in my heart for them, and I wish more active mormons would wake up to the reality of their own cult-like religion.','2008-10-19 18:31:17','2008-10-19 18:31:17'),(146,1,74,'\r\nSteve,\r\n\r\nYes!

There is no evidence for this claim. All the evidence from neuroscience relates to the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs). All the evidence from introspective studies refer to phenomenal events. The real problem is not the nature of the NCCs, nor the nature of the phenomenal events, but what is the relationship between NCCs and phenomenal events. As Ayer (1950) showed many years ago, information about how the brain works is not information relevant to the entirely different question of how these brain events are related to our conscious experiences. He pointed out that, if we claim that two sets of events A and B are identical, it is no use piling up a heap of facts about A, or about B: it is essential to demonstrate that A and B are (or are not) in fact identical. Since neurophysiology and neuroimaging only pile up facts about the brain, and introspectionist psychology only piles up facts about phenomenal consciousness, we need something more. In all brain imaging experiments we gain facts about the neural correlates of phenomenal consciousness (NCCs), not about phenomenal consciousness itself. As Ayer (1950) succinctly put itâ€”if we are trying to build a bridge across a river it is not enough merely to raise one of its banks. We need a powerful theory that connects the two. \r\n2. This account does not distinguish properly between phenomenology and knowledge in relation to consciousness. As Edmond Wright has repeatedly emphasized, sensations are phenomenal, but not epistemic, intermediates in perception. In associative agnosia the patient has intact phenomenology but defective epistemology about visual objects. In  blindsight the opposite occursâ€”no phenomenology but functioning epistemology. Visual phenomenology and visual epistemology are processed by different brain mechanisms.\r\n3. The theory contravenes Leibniz\'s Law of the Identity of Indiscernibles. This states that for two entities to be identical they must share the same properties. Neurons (and their activities) have one set of properties (e.g. size, shape, colour, electrical, etc.) and phenomenal objects (events) have quite different properties within these categories. So they cannot be identical. This is akin to Putnam\'s claim that \"Water is identical to H20\", which can be shown to be false by the following argument. If water is identical to H20, then so are steam and ice identical to H20. As \'identity\' is a transitive relation, this entails that water, steam and ice are identical, which is clearly contrary to fact.','2008-11-04 18:57:05','2008-11-04 18:57:05'),(165,1,86,'I quite agree with this camp\'s suggestion of the important role of resonance patterns in the brain underlying consciousnessâ€”for which there is much evidenceâ€” but I relate these to the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) not to phenomenal consciousness itself.','2008-11-04 19:09:21','2008-11-04 19:09:21'),(166,1,74,'\r\nHello John,\r\n\r\nVery exciting stuff.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view you are making some critical mistakes and confusing some important differences here:\r\n\r\n<<<<\r\nNeurons (and their activities) have one set of properties (e.g. size, shape, colour, electrical, etc.) and phenomenal objects (events) have quite different properties within these categories.

The point of view is unique, transient, and usually misconstrued by the viewer to be what the universe really is at that place and time, rather than a construction made to facilitate survival of the particular body long enough to ensure replication of the DNA which created it.\r\n\r\nI guess the key to the strength of _my_ point is the recognition of this transience. We each will die, and all too soon [in most cases any way], so the things we take to be so solid, so dependable, are shown to be processes in something much bigger. The _real_ universe, if I may be so bold, is almost completely unknowable to us. It is the noumenon that philosophers like to talk about. Apart from the consciousness that we experience, and the sentience that we can reasonably infer for other animals, and for others like us in distant parts of all the galaxies, the real universe is probably unconscious. \r\n\r\nAs far as I can see there is no good reason to expect awareness/consciousness anywhere else in the universe to have a much different kind of locus from what we are. Sure the kind of body, number of sensory modes, number of legs, size and type of eyes, antennae and so forth will vary, but UMSITW predicts that sentience and consciousness arise as part of the creation and updating of a model of self in the world, _wherever_ it takes place. \r\n\r\nSo, reflecting back to richwil\'s objection: \r\n\r\n* the experience is constructed - by the universe at a certain time and location within itself. \r\n* the details and flavour are dependent on the personal history and genetic inheritance of the individual, _of course_, but \r\n* the body is made from the stuff of the biosphere and is part of the biosphere, \r\n* the mind is constituted by memes which are present in thousands or millions of other people - in other words the culture without which the individual does not exist,\r\n* the fate of the individual - each of us - is bound up in the fate of the society which is the community/collective, call it what you will. \r\n\r\nSo the bottom line is that our individualism is as paradoxical as our experience of being here now. We cannot exist to _be_ individuals without already being inextricably part of everything we think we know to exist. I tend to think that the truest freedom we can attain comes about through seeking to be what we truly are and this entails acknowledging our membership of the biosphere, acknowledging our absolute dependence on hosts of unknown other people who all do their bit to keep our civilisation running, and acknowledging our abject dependence also on the memes - the concepts and values - which make up our thoughts and the constraints on our behaviour. As I see it we have to ally ourselves with the concepts and values we believe to sustain our civilisation and work towards developing and communicating these to the people we live and work with. \r\n\r\nAnything else will be self-defeating and a waste of time.\r\n\r\n-Cheers,\r\n\r\nMark','2008-11-09 16:25:33','2008-11-09 16:25:33'),(170,38,75,'\r\nLeon,\r\n\r\nIt looks like the site hosting the great images used in your statement is no longer hosting them?\r\n\r\nYou can host images at canonizer.com.

This is the paradigm that I am challenging; but not as a *replacement* paradigm (as occurred from the Ptolemaic system to the Copernican); but, rather, as a \"range of applicability\" paradigm (as occurred from classical physics to relativity). (I suggest, for example, that poets and song-writers do not really \'think\' about things, the words of songs typically not consisting of logical arguments, but observations which are not from the consciousness of the \'thinker\' at all.)\r\n\r\nWhat I am suggesting is that there are other dimensions of consciousness and \'truth\' conveyed by both the \'unconscious\' and the \"observing consciousness\".\r\n\r\nThe assertion that \"thinking requires a medium of thought -- which is the mind that carries the information of consciousness\" is no different than the assertion of classical physics that there must be an \"ether\" which is the medium to carry light waves. Of course, I deny both the existence of the \'thinker\' and \"to think\" as a verb. In accordance with Occam\'s Razor, there are thoughts as one particular dimension of consciousness; one of those thoughts being the thought of the \'thinker\'.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the assertion that I am suggesting that all researchers of the \'classical\' consciousness or the consciousness of the \'thinker\' simply be eliminated is categorically untrue; for the same reason that relativity theory was not a *replacement* for classical physics but was merely a \'range of applicability\' paradigm change.\r\n\r\nThat is, all that currently occurs within the rubric of research on cognitive psychology, neurology, etc. etc. etc. could very well be considered to be under to topic of \"mind\" experts (if that\'s what you want to call it, it\'s no skin off my back) or the \'classical\' consciousness or whatever else you would like to term it.\r\n\r\nI am NOT suggesting that all of this research and this perspective be eliminated *at all*; only that a category be established which acknowledges that there are, in fact, *3* rather than only one (the \'thinker\' or the \'mind\') dimension of consciousness. (And, if the consciousness of the \'thinker\' wants to deny the reality of both the \'unconscious\' and the \"observing consciousness\"; that, too, is fine by me; just so long as another category is established in which all of these dimensions of consciousness *can* be acknowledged.)\r\n\r\nUsing Lenny\'s rationale, I suppose the Michelson-Morley experiment and Einstein\'s relativity as well should be either \"expelled\" from any discussion on physics or \"ignored\" because they challenge the existence of the \"ether\".\r\n\r\nIt seems that such comments demonstrate just how close this society is coming to the official institution of \"thought police\".\r\n\r\n ','2008-11-16 00:00:55','2008-11-16 00:00:55'),(179,1,88,'Extending the analogy, I would suggest that \"mind experts\" would be a \'special case\' of \"consciousness experts\" in the same way that classical physics is a \'special case\' of relativity theory, in which the velocity of an object is an infinitesimally insignificant fraction of the velocity of light.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if a person wants to believe in (the religion of) the metaphysical duality, the existence of the \'thinker\' or the \"mind\", and that the scientific method is the source of *all* information/\'truth\' relevant to the understanding of human consciousness, his or her conclusions and comments would be included under \"mind experts\".\r\n\r\nBut, if a person acknowledges the reality of both the \'unconscious\' (the findings of the archetypal and Jungian analysts cannot simply be categorically disregarded as having *no* meaning at all relative to human consciousness) and the \"observing consciousness\"--thus acknowledging that there are other dimensions of consciousness beyond merely the consciousness of the \'thinker\'--his or her writings would be included under the category of \"consciousness experts\".\r\n\r\nNow, the problem arises, of course, because the consciousness of the \'thinker\' has a \"dog in the fight\" over the determination of a paradigm on consciousness itself. That is, the consciousness of the \'thinker\' is perpetually under threat of incipient psychosis (as described in the opening passages of the Second Meditation of Descartes); and, thus, is constitutionally opposed to *any* acknowledgement of the reality of the \'unconscious\'. And, thus, it has no experiential knowledge of the reality of the \"observing consciousness\" either.\r\n\r\nBut this is not unprecedented.\r\n\r\nFor people to change from the belief that the earth is the center of the universe to the realization that the earth rotated on its axis and revolved around the sun was also simply too psychologically traumatic for the vast majority of people. Those people died; and they were replaced by those who considered this \'new state of affairs\' to be simply a matter of fact with no psychological implications at all.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, addressing the issue of the consciousness of the \'thinker\' itself as a paradigm--and only one of the three dimensions of consciousness--will necessarily result in very strong opposition by the consciousness of the \'thinker\'; which is, in fact, fighting for its very sanity and survival by resisting such a \'range of applicability\' paradigm change. In fact, the consciousness of the \'thinker\' perceives this as, instead, a *replacement* paradigm change, even though it isn\'t.\r\n\r\nIt may very well require a lot of people simply to *die* with their current illusions about consciousness before they are replaced by people for whom this is \'no big deal\'; and it is generally acknowledged that there are, in fact, three dimensions of consciousness; and that the consciousness of the \'thinker\' is merely *one* frame of reference providing information relevant to the understanding of human consciousness.','2008-11-16 08:32:20','2008-11-16 08:32:20'),(180,1,88,'I must make this short because my second attempt; the system timed me out yesterday which was *very* frustrating.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to my mind [notice how *right* that expression sounds!] this particular schism is a storm in a teacup.

UMSITW is basically an \"identity theory\" which provides a coherent and entirely reasonable account of how it is that brain events embodying cerain dynamic logical structures coinside with sentience and self-awareness.

I have a feeling that this is a somewhat confused request. Consciousness is what we assume in ourselves, report about to others, and infer to be the experience of others because they say it is and we observe their behaviour to be consistent with our own. Many of us infer that many other animal species experience some degree of awareness, to the extent that it seems reasonable to be concerned whether they may be suffering or not due to our actions - or inaction as the case may be. \r\n\r\nIt is hard to see how this can be a scientific question unless one relies upon evidence of correlations amongst observable behaviours, personal reports, and/or brain images. This is because science *requires* objective descriptions, which entail words and much thinking. Science as such is somewhat tangential to the philosophical and potentially ethical questions which are many, deep, important, and never far from us if we but care to notice it. \r\n\r\nThe word mind has a different usage and, I think, more generally relates to what people may be conscious *of*: how people decide about things, how people learn, how people may or may not be aware of things, and so forth. One could say that the word \'mind\' refers to the *contents* of consciousness. A more colloquial phrase would be: \"What I\'m thinking about\". However, much of what goes on in the brain is not conscious; we do all sorts of things without being fully aware of ourselves doing them, and there are times when it becomes apparent that something has come about as the result of mental activity which must have been going on for a long time without the person concerned being aware of it. \r\n\r\n\r\nMichael writes: \r\n\"The image of the \"mind\" as a localized consciousness within a 3-dimensional curved space is a consequence of self-reflection which separates into an \'inner\' and an \'outer\' or a \'subjective\' and an \'objective\'\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Michael is imposing a particular viewpoint here and I can\'t help thinking there is a degree of naive realism at the base of it. The simple fact is that there has never been any demonstration of consciousness apart from the workings of a human brain and all inferences of sentience in other animals correlate with the working brain of the creature in question. As for assertions that supernatural beings [Being, whatever] make things happen, this has yet to be convincingly demonstrated in any scientifically acceptable way.\r\n\r\n\"So what?\" Well, what requires to be explained is how vast numbers of mental objects can occur within a human brain. I think there are some good explanations emerging, have been for some time. Against this the fundamentalist \'behavioural analysis\' people have a ploy of denying the reality of  internal workings of the brain, ie any description which talks about information processing, computation, whatever. They seem to assert that only \'behaviour\', \'responses\', \'contingencies [of the environment]\', etc, can be acknowledged; all other apparent manifestations of personal mental experience are denied. As such they have no way of connecting descriptions of overt behaviour, with complex internal processes [such as mental arithmetic for example] which generate that behaviour. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Michael is beset with a similar problem. His terminology may be different but his assertions still seem to constitute a straight forward denial of something I experience each and every day. \r\n\r\nAs for complaints about the use of \"sunrise\" and \"sunset\", these are the expressions that have been used for millenia. If I still use the word sunrise, it is not because I believe the sun is hauled up and across the sky by Phoebus in a magic chariot, it is because that is a term we use; \"daybreak\" would be just as good. Yes of course youngsters may naively think that the sun is moving; they will think like that until someone explains in a way they can understand about Earth rotating on its axis and orbitting the sun. \r\n\r\nSimilarly people remain tied to naive realism until something or other prompts sceptical questioning. It also generally requires some help from another person who can point out things that \"I myself\" don\'t notice about myself because there are things about me I can\'t normally see.

The more Michael writes the less he says.  \r\n\r\nApparently he has to know what \"naive realism\" means -- so as to understand exactly what he is commenting on (or ignoring).  Also, since he knows practically nothing about general relativity theory or the roles the ether and gravity play in it -- his claims that objective space becomes curved by subjective consciousness (one quantitative and the other qualitative) -- without explaining the geometry and the dynamics between them -- IS an aspect of \"naive realism\" and IS Imposing a paradigm on the study of mind and consciousness that has no scientific or philosophical basis.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, if Michael wishes to establish a new scientific paradigm (or, as he calls it, a \"science of consciousness\") -- he should be able to explain its origin and basis, what it is composed of, and how it can split apart into two other so called \"dimensions\" (which is a physical term) and how it bends space when it splits into what he calls, \"self reflected\" or \"classical\" consciousness.\r\nIn this latter state or condition, I would like to see Michael explain to us what and where is the \"self\" that consciousness supposedly reflects from?   \r\n\r\nAll of those assertions, however, are meaningless opinions -- without clearly explaining the nature of \"dimensions\" (in empirical or logical terms), as well as the dynamics and mechanism of how the information of the senses and the memory are physically processed, transformed, and transmitted to consciousness, and how such information is detected, transformed and experienced as qualia.  \r\n\r\nIOW, explain, understandably, how that observation -- whether direct or self reflected, or psychotic -- is perceived and responded to willfully by our individual consciousness... Thus. proving any other paradigm either wrong, or a subset of the new paradigm -- like classical physics became an approximate subset of modern physics -- while some of its conclusions, such as gravity, space, light, matter, energy, electrodynamics, etc. were proven partially or entirely wrong.  \r\n\r\nIf that can\'t be done -- without all the empty talk, such as wrong analogies, mixed metaphors, and unfounded assertions and denials -- Michael may as well be babbling gobbledygook (from a physical or even a psychophysical point of view).

It is a word from my paradigm, not the secularist paradigm. >>\r\n\r\nThen, would you be satisfied if we changed the name to \"Consciousness and Mind Authorities\"? ;-)\r\n\r\nThat way, you wouldn\'t have to prove any of the assertions you make -- which are now verified only by biblical scriptures, second hand revelations, religious philosophers, mixed metaphors, vague allegories, and irrelevant similes.\r\n\r\nAs for your claim that \"Jungian, archetypal or analytical psychologists and psychiatrists are also experts on consciousness\"... That\'s ridiculous... Since none of those disciplines (that I finished studying in depth over 30 years ago) -- that deal only with the behavioral and cognitive effects of consciousness, coupled with mind, memory, brain, body, senses, etc. -- can have any knowledge of the actual metaphysical and physical causes or mechanisms of consciousness, or have any ability to explain the real hard problems of consciousness study (awareness, will, qualia, non locality, brain-mind binding, etc.) or the causal nature of subjectivity as contrasted with objectivity.\r\n\r\nNot to say that their findings, might not have some value in understanding the psychic and psychological nature of human beings... Which seems to be as far as Michael\'s theory of consciousness appears to go.  \r\n\r\nAs for having any scientific validity on the physical spatial (or even hyperspace) level -- forget it.  Where is the \"unconscious,\" unless in a higher order metaphysical or hyperspatial field of consciousness?  Where are the images we experience in dreams?  What is the cause and nature of altered states of consciousness, psi phenomena, etc.?   None of those psychological, or any supernatural *creator-based* theory of consciousness, can answer any of that.\r\n\r\nHowever, fundamental consciousness, or subjectivity, which covers raw awareness, interpretation and experience of qualia, and appropriate response to meet particular needs of an organism, goes much further down the chain of evolution than any of those psychology disciplines (or Michael\'s \"paradigm\") can even approach.\r\n\r\nThat so called \"paradigm,\" BTW, still is based on the same supernatural \"God creator\" of the \"creationists\" -- regardless of whether or not they base their theology on misinterpreted revelations and mistaken biblical metaphors.\r\n\r\nConsequently -- since that creationist premise arbitrarily denies the proved auto-creative (if not morphogenetic field based) process of evolution that starts from conscious single celled living organisms, and extends all the way up to mankind -- which evolutionary theory implies that neither consciousness nor mankind (the only animal that *thinks*) is created by \"God\"-- in no way can Michael\'s theory be considered as a \"scientific\" paradigm.  \r\n\r\nIf anything it could be considered as a special case falling under the general heading of speculative psychological, philosophical or religious views of consciousness. In fact, it doesn\'t even have a \"psychophysical\' basis, as suggested by Chalmers, that would make it eligible to be called a \"science.\"\r\n\r\nI don\'t think that any of the ideas of Descartes, Krishnamurti, Freud, Jung, or any of the prophets who received revelations can be considered as \'scientific\" verification of any theory of consciousness or mind.\r\n\r\nSo to compare it to other truly scientific paradigms, like relativity, quantum physics, etc. -- besides being pretentious, is completely erroneous and misleading.\r\n\r\nHowever, if Michael thinks that the ABC model of cosmogenesis is wrong (which incidentally is not mine alone) -- I would like to hear his reasoned counter arguments (without any snide ad hominem remarks) presented honestly and directly, and based on a logical alternative to ABC\'s fractal topological geometry and electrodynamics. Any, reference (as proof) to any \"authorities,\" scriptural sources, hearsay revelations, or philosophical ramblings will not suffice.\r\n\r\nAs for ABC\'s hypothetical proposition of potential phenomenal consciousness being a fundamental aspect of zero-point absolute space (as a living entity in itself)... That, in my view, is a perfectly logical assumption based on the fact that no one can prove any alternative \"scientific\" or rational cause of consciousness (or even matter, for that matter).\r\n\r\nThe rest of the ABC model of cosmogenesis, underlying ALL phenomenal reality, is pure \"scientific\" deduction based on fractal topological geometry coupled with the electrodynamics underlying relativity, quantum, string, M, and holographic paradigm theories -- that are now on the cutting edges of scientific thought... All, together, very close to becoming synthesized into the ultimate unified field theory of everything... With such objectivity, being totally separate from subjective consciousness -- although intimately interconnected with it on the  *information* levels -- as thoroughly explained by the ABC model.\r\n\r\nBeyond all that, there cannot be a separate \"Science of Consciousness\" -- since subjectivity or conscious qualities cannot be explained in objective or quantitative terms -- and any assumptions about the psychological aspects of consciousness or its relationship to time and space, can only be presumptive or speculative. (And this, BTW, includes my ABC proposition of consciousness being a fundamental a priori *quality* of absolute space -- regardless of its reasonableness.) \r\n\r\nEven other multidimensional theories of consciousness, and its relationship to spacetime, it\'s curvature, etc., both metaphysical and physical, can have no scientific validity without a causal explanation of how such dimensions of space came into being in the first place.  Explaining any aspect of consciousness (which cannot have \"dimensions\" in the usual sense of the word that applies only to physical things) -- without explaining its medium of information and the source and transmission of the energy of will -- is superficially vague and incomplete.\r\n\r\nSo, claiming that there is no rational basis for a \"science of consciousness\" (and therefore, no consciousness \"experts\") -- without fully explaining the metaphysical or physical/phenomenal basis of the *information* of consciousness, its transitional medium of mind and memory (between brain, body, senses, etc.), its detection and perception, as well as willful response -- is a reasonable argument, and is in no way dictatorial or \"fascist\" (which word, used pejoratively by a \"non thinker,\" is not even applicable in this context ;-)','2008-11-24 20:30:16','2008-11-24 20:30:16'),(212,1,88,'Lenny says \r\n\"consciousness (which cannot have \"dimensions\"\r\nin the usual sense of the word that applies only to physical things\"\r\n\r\n\'Dimensions\', in the sense of Cartesian co-ordinates, applies just as well to non-physical entities such as after-images, the visual field itself, psychedelic hallucinations, etc. These are spatial entities that can be located by a numbering system in the spatial field they exist in.

Of course, to fully understand the change in nature of those realms, this can only be experienced subjectively by each individual Self.  \r\n\r\nAs for the location of the self \"inside the head of the body image,\" I cannot entirely buy that -- since there is no reason for it to be there except when it is absorbed in seeing and hearing -- which focus at a single point of experience in the center of the physical head, due to the 3-D spherical geometry of their radiation and the position of the eyes and ears.  Therefore our perceptive awareness is located wherever our attention or focus of  concentration places it.\r\n\r\nAccording to the fractal field model of spatial reality, when in Nirvana, the Self could be centered at the top of the head outside the body itself.

And as a Mormon, I myself also sustain our prophet and any such decisions he makes along these lines.  I abide by the directives - I will not be attending any of my children\'s or other family member\'s weddings in the temple because they consider me, as an atheist, to be unworthy.  And I will fully accept, support, and abide by such.\r\n\r\nBut, that issue is not the purpose of this topic.

In an effort to capture more of a public history of our discussion here I\'ve created this thread in the \'representational\' camp forum.\r\n\r\nThere are clearly multiple dimensions developing in this discussion.  The two big ones seem to be representationalism, and another is a belief in the reality of qualia.  All the people in the camp so far believe in both the reality of qualia, and the importance of representationalism.  But it is becoming obvious that in order to bring more people on board in this survey, we need to split things up to some degree to quantitatively capture our differences and what we can agree is most important.\r\n\r\nIn some communication with Dr Edmond Write, It is evident that he does not consider his theories to be representational.  He contrasts his works to those of Michael Tye, John <nowiki>McDowell</nowiki> and others and I don\'t yet know very much about any of this.  Would anyone be willing to contact any competitors like this and inform them of our effort so we can capture their input as well?  Sooner is usually better than later.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that Dr Write points out that some representatitional theories do not place importance on qualia in their theories while his theories (and all currently in the camp) believe in the reality and importance of qualia.\r\n\r\nSo in these two dimensions, it appears that there are some theories that are representational, and those that are not.  Also, there are those that believe in the reality of qualia, and those that do not.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we had a powerful way to represent multiple dimensions concisely and quantitatively, but even a simple tree hierarchy optimization, like is currently being used at canonizer.com, seems overly complex for many people to easily grasp.  So given this kind of a less than perfect optimized way of represent such multiple dimensions, we are left with the task of selecting which dimension is more important.\r\n\r\nWhich dimension do we place as the \'root\' camp representing what most of us believe?  Is it the representationalist dimension, or the qualia dimension?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the representationalist dimension is by far the most important.  Having this dimension at the root of our POV structure, enables us to have competing sub camps for \'qualophiles\' and \'qualophobes\' and so on that are all supporting the much more important representationalist camp.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we go down this road, it will isolate people like Dr Write as a competitor at this higher representational level.  A similar \'qualophile\' and \'qualophobe\' structure could develop underneath such a competitor to a \'representationalist\' camp to capture this additional dimension.  Or some other entirely different structure where qualia is much more important could become a more dominant competitor at this level.  Not yet knowing much about Dr Wright\'s theories, and his competitors it\'s hard for me to anticipate.  It\'s also hard to know if what I\'m talking about makes any sense within that kind of theory.  I hope some of you can help with this.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the bottom line is, I\'m going to continue work on developing a statement for a root representationalist camp - anticipating the development of sub qaualophobe, qualophile, and many other theories in supporting camp positions.\r\n\r\nI am hoping that People that think things should be structured differently, if any, will continue to participate, to help the rest of us better understand what it is they are arguing for by concisely stating, representing, and converting others to their camp.  In short, I hope they will continue to \'canonize\' their differing point of view and compete with us at this level - and in the end, may the best \'camp representation\' win sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\nNote: All the above is all according to the way things are currently represented in my still very ignorant head.  Given more information I can quickly repent and change camps.  There may be much better ways to think about all of this, or much better ways to concisely and quantitatively capture the best and most important theories at the root levels.  Keeping the goal of producing a concise and quantitative representation of the most important theories, if anyone has any better ideas or ways to think of things or structure things, I hope you\'ll all help us out.  How many people agree that the representational dimension is the most important?  How many people think differently?  Why?  Is there something more important than all this that I am still missing?  I don\'t think anyone can accomplish anything alone, so the quality of anything we are able to produce is highly dependent on the number of people that participate and help out and work to get the best theories appropriately \'canonized\'.\r\n\r\nUpward,\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n','2008-11-29 21:23:18','2008-11-29 21:23:18'),(219,1,74,'# Representationalists believe that certain aspects of what goes on in our brains/minds represent physical objects in some way.

With such even if we create a sub camp to the representational camp for \'qualophiles\' we will risk not having the support of the non representationalists to help us out since they will disagree with us on the importance of representationism.

Representationalism is a trivial truth. All that remains to be discussed is the exact form of the representation. Obviously sensory brain events \"represent\" particular events in the outside world in some way. The details of this are a matter for neurophysiology to supply. The question remains, however, is whether this is all there is to the story, or whether there is another layer of representation from brain to mind. That is, are the brain events the FINAL stage in the representation story, or are they an intermediate stage? \r\nThe reality, or otherwise, of qualia is just as. or more important. In any case, if you do not agree with that, why does one approach HAVE to be judged to be more important than the other. This implies that we already know the answer which of course we do not.

It is simply a rigorous measure of consensus.  Before Einstein published his first paper, he had no reputation (other than that of a patent clerk).  At that time there was near unanimous consensus amongst experts that F = M * A.  Then, with his new paper, he basically announced a new minority camp, that this relationship between F, M and A was not universally correct.\r\n\r\nBecause of his initial reputation, or lack there of, people were right to be skeptical of his claims.  You can\'t give lots of time to the millions of kooks that are incorrectly proposing revolutions of various kinds.  But of course, everyone quickly converted to Einstein\'s new camp soon after his paper was published - especially once the scientific data proved and demonstrated his theory correct.\r\n\r\nCanonizer.com is simply meant to be a more rigorous way to quantitatively measure such migration of consensus as things move forward.\r\n\r\nKnowing who were the first ones to be in the right camp, before everyone else, is also critical reputation information.  Once Einstein had such a well deserved great reputation, everyone deservedly gave anything he said much more heed.  Again, canonizer.com is intended to rigorously and quantitatively measure and track such reputation information about such things as who is in the right camp and how much sooner than everyone else.  It is easy for everyone to know about the reputation of the one top person, and the big theories, but what about the billions of other people and all the theories with less consensus?  We also need to know concisely and quantitatively their reputation and amount of consensus also.  The deserving ones (first in the right camps) are all the people we want to trust more, the next time around to lead us forward at ever faster and in more efficient ways.\r\n\r\nSo, there are two independent critical parts here at canonizer.com.  Fist, there is the theories themselves.  Such belongs in topics like this one:\r\n\r\nhttp://canonizer.com/topic.asp/23\r\n\r\nwhich is meant to concisely capture all theories, including the kooky ones.  The big problem today is there are so many obviously kooky theories about the mind, and such an extreme amount of time and mental effort to fully understand each one, we desperately need to have some way of using collaboration so each and every person need not spend the extreme amount of effort required to determine which theories are the kooky ones, which ones nobody else should waste time on, and which ones do indeed deserve more consideration by more people.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, the biggest problem today in the field of study of the mind, is there are way to many kooks and their kooky theories making all this noise.  People spend so much time arguing about quibbles surrounding the good theories, that you can\'t tell them from the poor ones.  Sure, a few experts that spend all day every day studying them, can expend the required time to fully comprehend all of them and know why the kooky ones are indeed kooky.  But what about the rest of us?  Not everybody can spend the huge amount of investment required to fully understand all theories of mind being proposed by everyone.\r\n\r\nSo, in addition to the theories themselves, we need as much reputation as possible, so we can both know who are the kooks, AND which are the kooky theories - all so the good signal that is surely there, can more easily and efficiently stand out from all the noise that is destroying this field of study.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as with most controversial or \'religious\' issues, there is a big part of values and desires that must be factored in to any theories or beliefs or effort to measure such.  And for each individual, what one likes is usually very unique.  So, again, for such it is critical to know who is in what camp, when they convert to another camp, why, and so on.\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n','2008-11-30 19:03:37','2008-11-30 19:03:37'),(228,1,88,'Brent wrote:\r\n\r\n<<So, there are two independent critical parts here at canonizer.com.

But, as such, I find myself agreeing with different statements of *many* of the camps currently listed; while, nevertheless, having to start my own camp to answer a question which has a relatively minuscule role in my own theory.

We are just saying things in different ways.\r\n\r\nWhen you say: \"Representationalism is a trivial truth\", within this camp, or amongst this representational crowd, I would agree with you.\r\n\r\nBut when I first started coming to this community earlier this year I would ask \'experts\', people that had many reputable publications, and / or were functioning as editors and \'peers\' of reputable peer reviewed journals, and so on what their thoughts about representational theories of perception were.  I was dumfounded how many reputable people were completely ignorant to anything about even the idea of representationalism.\r\n\r\nAnd, evidently, there are many people that do know about representationalism, that are in a very different camp about whether it is a \"trivial truth\".  Apparently Dr Wright is in this camp?\r\n\r\nIf you took a survey, I would bet 99% of the general population, and the majority of people heavily involved in this field of study, would say that the phenomenal quality of red is something on the surface of the strawberry, not something in our head.  These are anecdotal numbers we definitely need to get some real hard data behind and monitor as things progress.\r\n\r\nSure, qualia are important, but until you can get a handle on where people think the important red is located, and properly educate them about what must be \"a trivial truth\", you can\'t even truly begin to have further discussions about qualia since you will never be able to talk about the same thing with anyone in any real meaningful way.\r\n\r\nSo I think it is first most important to show how much consensus there is on this representational idea, where our awareness is located, then the consensus on qualia can follow much sooner once this is clear to all the people still so clueless on this critical, should be obvious issue.\r\n\r\nYou said: \"I would vote for having two parallel processes in the camp structure\" and this is exactly what I am proposing - that we have a parallel structure initially rooted in representationalism - with the non representationalists in a completely different competing branches.  This way we can show how much consensus there is on this first issue in a much more unified way and force the non representationalists to clearly declare their ignorance and stupidity (IMHO) which will of course effect their reputations.\r\n\r\nNotice the much more dominant idea that the hard problem is or isn\'t based on something \'supernatural\' in the structure here:\r\n\r\nhttp://canonizer.com/topic.asp/23\r\n\r\nNotice how all the people that think it is something \'supernatural\' are forced to declare such by being outside of the most well supported branch that says it has nothing to do with the \'supernatural\'.  Of course this effects their reputations as it rightly should.  When talking with someone, or reading material from them, you need to know definitively their position on such.  Today it is too easy to avoid the issue on to many things like this, causing so much of the confusion and noise everywhere.\r\n\r\nIf we put the qualia dimension at the root, this will fracture all representationalists into the qualophile or qualophobe branches of parallel structures rather than having them unified at the root.  This will make it much more difficult and in my opinion will greatly confuse the issue and slow things down significantly in the long run.\r\n\r\nUltimately, what you or I want isn\'t as important as what everyone else wants.  If we start with a camp rooted in representationalism (or visa versa), then as more people join, we can monitor how many total people are in the rooted representational camp, versus the total number of people in qualophile camps split between the representational and other competing camps.  If there are clearly more total qualophiles than representationalists, then, absolutely, the structure should be inverted - based in the more well supported qualophile camp (and visa versa if we start the other way).  The more well supported camps should always be higher and more unified in the structure - with the ultimate goal of getting the accepted truth migrated towards the agreement statement as more and more people begin to agree on particular issues.\r\n\r\nDo you violently agree? ;)  Or do you think there are more qualophiles than representationlists?\r\n\r\nAnd much more importantly, what does everyone else think?\r\n\r\nBrent\r\n\r\n','2008-11-30 22:18:16','2008-11-30 22:18:16'),(230,1,74,'Brent,\r\nYou say \"If you took a survey, I would bet 99% of the general population, and the majority of people heavily involved in this field of study, would say that the phenomenal quality of red is something on the surface of the strawberry, not something in our head.\" You present this as \'representationalism\' but to me it looks more like naive realism.

This usually gives us enough insight to respond to situations _as the other appears to be responding_. This allows companions and helpers to embody meaningful assistance and support as well as cement relationships in personal situations. It also forms the basis of creative art whereby the artist can change the world in some way [the work of art] and so induce emulations of the artist\'s own thoughts and feelings. \r\n\r\n* in a \"Matrix\" [the movie] type context it is questionable how an exact \"same\" experience could be induced without decreasing the autonomy and or personal awareness of the individual/s concerned. The problem is this: the _mind_ of the individual [which I see as the individual\'s description of the world or model of the universe] has evolved over the life of the individual through billions of adjustments to synapses. These adjustments are \"fixed\" as potential permanent features of the person\'s brain due to feedback processes within the cell which adjust the rates of transcription of DNA patterns into messenger RNA, etc. When these synapse are participating in dynamic logical structures or cell assembly activation patterns, that part of the person\'s model of the universe is active, otherwise it exists only implicitly within the brain. This means that experience is embodied in _that_ brain. \r\n\r\n* What follows from the above is there is no guarantee that this embodiment could be transferred to another brain or brain emulation and be able to produce the same effects. Everything which I have read so far about brain \"placticity\" would seem to support my contention. \r\n\r\n* On the other hand, in a start-from-scratch, digital mind cloning scheme where the substrate could perhaps be a standardised parallel processing architecture, I believe there _is_ a way in which minds could be stored/backed up. In this sort of situation it may well be feasible to extract significant information from the back up _so long as_ the backup data packets stored during and after the learning of the skill were not later over-written. \r\n\r\nThe reason this could work is that the backup system I have in mind _records only significant changes_ in synaptic settings as or very soon after they occur. As long as the storage location is known for the serial stream to the backup device created during and for some time after the learning, then that sequence of adjustments to known [i.e. numbered] synapses could be fed to any architecturally identical device and the skill or memory of experience would be transferred. \r\n\r\nI am currently trying to write a science fiction novel _Shortcut to Imadjinning_ incorporating this concept. The robotic mobil units [or \"ant-things\"] used by the aliens normally have the intrinsic dexterity and proportional strength of an ant with power tools and the intelligence of a well adjusted, fight-enabled, guide dog. What they can receive though is specific downloads of specialist skills ranging from micro surgery to baby sitting. Progress is slow on the writing though. The draft is on my website. \r\n\r\nOne could say that none of the above should have bearing on the issue, but then Brent\'s query invoked \"comprehensive emulation\" shall we say. \r\n\r\n* My basic contention remains: that any process of perception, of anything, is a process of construction within a brain of some sort on the basis of patterns attributed to variations of environmental energy impinging on the body belonging to the brain. This will be true whether it is a simulated body and brain or a \"real\" one. So it remains true that the source of the variations of environmental energy cannot, by means of _those_variations alone, be known with certainty by the perceiver to be whatever it is the perceiver construes them to be. \r\n* As this applies also to any source of verification, as far as I see, a self aware subjective being, should infer that what he, she, or it perceives is always only what they believe the percept to be. It is naive realism to assume otherwise. \r\n\r\nThus Mark\'s second axiom is \"Things are what we believe them to be, until we discover otherwise.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nYours _truly_ ... :-)','2008-12-07 06:21:47','2008-12-07 06:21:47'),(240,1,74,'Duh, in the nineth paragraph of that last post, where I mentioned robotic ant-things, with skills like ants and personalities like guide dogs, I meant _\"flight_ enabled\", not fight enabled.

And it makes so much sense framed with in a representationalist paradigm.  Great piece of work!\r\n\r\nThe canonizer camp structure is precisely designed for these types of differences of beliefs.  The more major \'paradigms\' exist higher in the branching structure, such as \"Consciousness has nothing to do with the super natural\" and everyone else is on some other major paradigm branch.\r\n\r\nI also think things like measuring and forcing people to explicitly declare just where they are, tracking where people are in a way that hurts their reputation when in fallacy camps, and facilitating cooperative efforts where everyone in the right camp can work together, as a team will greatly enhance the ability of truth to be recognized and become dominate much more efficiently and completely against the still primitive mistaken majority.\r\n\r\nUpward,\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n','2008-12-21 03:47:09','2008-12-21 03:47:09'),(256,1,74,'Hi Steve and Brent,\r\nAs you both know I am in strong agreement with both your positions - albeit very reticent to use a word like \"spiritual\" as Brent does. \r\n\r\nBut also I can see why adopting a deep representationalist viewpoint is extraordinarily difficult for most people. The paradigm shift is quite literally earth-shaking. I got here I think because I had been absorbing bits and pieces of related theory and descriptions of supporting evidence [eg Oliver Sachs\'s _the Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat_, and others] and had experienced a couple of intensely emotional paradigm shifts already. \r\n\r\nThe reason why our deep changes are like this, IMO, is precisely because the constructs which constitute our thoughts and perceptions of the world are tightly constrained by associations [via amygdala and basal ganglia, whatever,] which key into our deepest level survival strategies. So in effect we cannot change until, at a very deep level, we become ready to accept that the new paradigm does not constitute a threat to our survival. In other words the deep preparatory thinking occurs unconsciously. When the new paradigm becomes apparent, this is a true act of creation within the person\'s mind wherein an array of previously disparate constructs _fall together_ as a more effective representational strategy. \r\n\r\nMy assumption is that this process allows a reduction in the amount of energy needed to maintain exclusions between conflicting constructs and in the state of fight/flight arousal which was previously provoked by the potential threat attributed to elements in the conflict. \r\n\r\nOn my website I have a description of the amazingly powerful emotional effect of such a shift I experienced one day in the late \'70s after which I decided to be a Christian [membership since reversed though, which I also describe a bit.] \r\n\r\n* http://www.arach.net.au/~mpeaty/aboutme.html#I%20used%20to%20be%20a%20Christian.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also have a copy [with his permission to use it] of My e-friend Peter Main\'s experience of _seeing_ how representations are in his brain, how the 3Dness experience must be _in_ the brain. \r\n\r\n* http://www.arach.net.au/~mpeaty/ch2a.html#An%20example\r\n\r\nSeason\'s greeting!\r\n\r\nMark Peaty','2008-12-21 05:34:26','2008-12-21 05:34:26'),(257,90,108,'Thank you Robert Ettinger for that reasonable listing of what qualia are _not_. I like it.\r\n\r\nMy proposed solution fulfils pretty much all of the criteria but pushes the envelope inwards a bit in one or two places. I\'m hoping we can isolate the discrepant bits and nut out why Robert asserts a couple of things which might \"kibosh\" his quest unless we tweak the terminology or definitions a bit. \r\n\r\n* My proposal is that human brains spontaneously generate, and then cause to evolve, dynamic logical structures which are made of transiently self-sustaining swarms or clouds of neuronal surface impulses [depolarisations]. For any such cloud or swarm the neurons in question sustain the pattern of impulse pathways until the pattern is suppressed by other such swarms or it mutates into one or more different, consequential, swarms. \r\n\r\nThis idea is not new and other people have named this sort of thing \"cell assembly\", \"repertoire\", \"singularity\",  and so forth. The key underlying concept is that the figurative nature or meaning of the thing is embodied in the locations of the neuron members of the interacting assembly and also in the temporal features of the \"mass action\" manifested by the vast numbers of impulses. \r\n\r\nThere are significant reasons for believing that the mass-action features of cell assemblies are crucial. Steve Lehar explains some of these on his website:\r\n\r\nhttp://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/persintro/assumptions.html\r\n\r\n[other links to be had from wikipedia: \r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Lehar ]\r\n\r\nThe simplest inference about mass-action features is that such cell assemblies involve some feedback loops and what Gerald Edelman calls re-entrant signalling. The outcome of these is that the swarms of impulses rapidly fall into large scale wave patterns which constrain the spatia-temporal structure of the self-sustaining cloud. \r\n\r\nMy rather simple minded way of explaining how this must work is by analogy with the problem of \"water hammer\" that occurs often in domestic water systems. What happens in water hammer is that some features of a particular piping arrangement, in particular a length of straight-ish piping leading to a tap [faucet for USA] and a loose washer/jumper in that tap, cause the washer to start oscillating as the tap is opened so that the flow of water is repeatedly stopped and started as the washer/jumper bounces up and down on the valve seat; I suspect also that a trapped air bubble is often involved but maybe it is just a consequence of the limited compressibility of the water itself. Note that the energy driving the hammer phenomenon comes from the pressure of the mains supply.\r\n\r\nHow this applies to cell assemblies is that neuron membrane depolarisations are not simply a tiny current of charge across the membrane which propagates in a kind of domino effect, there is also a minuscule movement of mass which constitutes a pressure/temperature wave along the bi-lipid cell membrane. The energy diving this system of course comes from the supply to the ion pumps which move the sodium and potassium ions back across thus resetting the membrane for its next impulse. My contention is that there is a feedback to individual neurons from the mass of other neurons around - and possibly via glial cells also at longer time scales - which is mediated by or a consequence of longer range electrical and kinetic/phonic effects. \r\n\r\n* The net result is that any activated neuronal cell assembly should fall into a dynamic logical structure that is capable of influencing the brain in a potentially significant way. This can be by excluding other cell assemblies from activating or by provoking different assemblies into existence.\r\n\r\nThat such dynamic logical structures can and usually do represent things other than themselves can wait for my next post.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nMark Peaty \r\n','2008-12-28 06:01:52','2008-12-28 06:01:52'),(260,96,48,'Folks,\r\n\r\nI think there is a possibility that there might be a better, more accurate structure that appropriately represents all the best theories of consciousness held by everyone than currently exists in the [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/23 Hard Problem topic].\r\n\r\nBut so far, I have not yet seen any information about or evidence for such.

Now, however, we come to the position of this model that our scientists can not extract information from spirit or resurrected matter. This is a controversial topic. This position is based on the following. \r\n\r\nSpirit matter is different than physical matter and can not be discerned by our natural eyes. Joseph Smith said spirit matter was different from physical matter and could only be discerned by purer eyes. Moses said that if he had tried to see God with his natural eyes, he would have been destroyed. He did see God because he was transfigured before God. God in this case was Jesus Christ who had a spirit body not a resurrected body. I don\'t recall the scriptures specifically saying that resurrected matter can only be discerned by spiritual eyes via transfiguration, but I think it is a reasonable assumption that the same could be said of resurrected matter as is said of spirit matter.\r\n\r\nResurrected matter will exist forever, and resurrected persons will live forever. In contrast, all matter that is observable to scientists is physical or mortal matter. It is true that physical matter can be transformed into energy, and vice versa, but organisms composed of physical matter will die. Scientists have instrumentation to extract information from physical matter, but they have never had the opportunity to test those instruments on spirit or resurrected matter. As illustrated by the examples given above, resurrected matter behaves in different ways than physical matter, implying resurrected matter is controlled by different laws than physical matter. Moses said that if he had tried to see God with his natural eyes, he would have been destroyed. I think this implies a barrier of some kind that separates spirit and resurrected matter from physical matter, and I see no reason to expect that scientific research could breach that barrier. Of course, if the scientists and their instruments could be \"transfigured\" in some way (what ever that means) they might be able to extract information from spirit and resurrected matter.\r\n\r\nSome people say that if there is an interaction between spirit or resurrected matter and physical matter, then scientists can extract information about the spirit matter. Actually, I think that all the scientists can do is extract information about the effect of the interaction of the spirit matter on the physical matter. For example, suppose a person were undergoing a brain scan while seeing spirit or resurrected matter. The scan would give information about the person\'s brain during that experience, but it would give no information about the spirit or resurrected matter itself. The question that needs answering is, \"If a spirit or resurrected person were to undergo a brain scan, or other testing by scientists, would the scan or tests show anything?\" Nobody can answer that question, and any attempts to characterize spirit or resurrection matter, in my opinion, is just speculation.\r\n\r\nThis is my last post to explain this model.

Those children will be immortal, but they will have spirit bodies not resurrected bodies. Your spirit children will have agency, and not all of them will choose to follow you. Our Heavenly Father had one-third of his spirit children choose to not follow him. Thus, in his case, two-thirds of his spirit children will receive mortal bodies and later resurrected bodies. As I understand the sequence of events in Heavenly Father\'s plan, after all of those two-thirds have been resurrected (many of them won\'t be resurrected until after the Millennium) they will live in the peace that you hope for, although many, probably most, of them won\'t be living with you in the Celestial Kingdom, and they won\'t have the fullness of peace.\r\n\r\nThis model of multiple universes doesn\'t include agency, because in forming the model I was focusing on the existence of multiple universes not the characteristics of those universes. Concerning the characteristics, agency is apparently a key component. Heavenly Father had a plan for our salvation, but he didn\'t force that plan on us. He allowed us to exercise our agency. Agency was involved in the choice of a Redeemer (Jehovah vs. Lucifer). Agency was involved when Lucifer rebelled against the Father when he wasn\'t chosen. Agency was involved when all of the spirit children had to choose if they would follow Jehovah or Lucifer. Agency was involved in the war in Heaven.

What can you do about this, other than teaching them and demonstrating righteousness to them? Nothing. They have to make their own decisions about their lives. If you were to deprive your spirit children of their agency, you would cease to be god (the scriptures don\'t say it that explicitly, but that is my interpretation from an extension of Alma 42 to the atonement and not just to repentance.

In time however the pre-scientific universe will be more definitely a thing of the past and so many of the traditional view points and their supporting idioms will be more clearly seen to be outdated metaphors and rules of thumb. We can help this along by accepting that subjectivity is what it is like to be a model of self in the world [better: the updating of such].

There is however, no good evidence now available to support the idea of mental activity/perceptual experience occurring in the absence of neuronal activity.

Before we had \'brain linked\', we had \'part of the brain\'.  But the issue with this was people like John Smythies did not support any kind of \'identity theory\' (the idea that consciousness is only the brain.) as I believe they call it.\r\n\r\nSo this is why we converted to \'brain linked\'.  But after further consideration, it was determined that \'brain linked\' really had no significant utility at this more inclusive level.  Everyone believes that consciousness is somehow linked to the brain, so there isn\'t much of a reason to state such in the title of a camp at this level since there is nothing else to distinguish this idea from.  Titles of camps are critical to be very efficient and concise, so it seemed that \'brain linked\' was not important enough to be included.\r\n\r\nOver on that topic, we decided that at this representational level, we wanted to include more people.  So it was decided that the degree to which consciousness is part of, or linked to the brain would be included in sub camps.  And I think the result over on that topic was a powerful and concise representation of the diversity of opinion and agreement on this issue.\r\n\r\nSo, mostly, this change on this topic, for the same reasons, is just to keep things consistent across parallel structures.\r\n\r\nSo, here are the issues I see with what we have now:\r\n\r\n* Parallel structures and terminologies are not consistent.\r\n* We only want concise definitive words in titles that make it easy to identify camps in comparison with other camps.\r\n* We want to be more inclusive at higher super camps, less well accepted ideas can be included at lower level camps.\r\n\r\nWould you agree that all these are important?  If so, how might we change things to accomplish this in both topics, in a way that will not be objectionable to you?\r\n\r\nUpward,\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2009-04-05 17:45:52','2009-04-05 17:45:52'),(316,1,102,'Brent\r\n\r\nQESM does not fit under the subjective mind is made of qualia (SMQ)  camp for the simple and important reason that QESM holds that the subjective mind is more than qualia.

Now we can move our conversation to this public forum for the camp.  I\'ve always been interested in the Ranking Runoff voting process.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like this is a two pass algorithm?  One must use some type of scoring to determine what the top few choices are (certainly, one\'s 3rd choice doesn\'t get as much of a vote in this first pass than a first choice?)  Then once the top (how many?) choices are selected, everyone gets one full vote at this level, even if it is not their first choice.\r\n\r\nIt also seems like such a \'runoff\' system is only to determine one top choice, where as current implemented algorithms give ranking values to all choices so they can all be compared, rather than just determining the top choice?\r\n\r\nAlso, I\'m not sure how this would be much different than what is currently being used and what additional value it would have.\r\n\r\nThe canonizer algorithms are all implemented in PERL.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can provide some pseudo code for this Ranking runoff algorithm?\r\n\r\nFor example, currently, after a \'$value\' is determined from the selected canonizer (i.e. the PhD canonizer gives one vote for PhDs and zero $value for everyone else), it is run through this algorithm:\r\n\r\n    if ($multi_supporter) {\r\n        return($value / (2 ** ($support_order + 1)));\r\n    } else {\r\n        return($value);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nwhere $multi_supporter is a flag indicating more than one camp supported, and $support_order is an indicator if this is your 2nd, 3rd, and so on choice.\r\n\r\nAll the canonizer code has been developed in an open source way.

Yet several people have communicated to me that an important part of what they believe about the mind is its identity with the brain.  And they have also indicated this isn\'t adequately represented in the current camp survey structure.  I happen to currently be in this camp and would like to see these ideas much more explicitly represented in a camp that we all support.\r\n\r\nSo, towards this end, I propose a competing sibling camp to John Smythies Smythies-Car Hypothosis camp as defined below.\r\n\r\nI propose that the following 3 sub camps be moved into a supporting sub camp position of this new camp:\r\n\r\n* Consciousness Arises from Any Equivalent Functional Organization\r\n* Nature Has Ineffable Phenomenal Properties\r\n* Self-centered virtual reality \r\n\r\nAs always, if anyone has any ways of improving this, or if they would object to any of these changes when proposed, please help us work out some better way to do things for which you would not object.\r\n\r\nUpward,\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Name: Mind-Brain Identity\r\n* Title: Mind-Brain Identity Theory\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that the mind or consciousness is identical with brain states.\r\n\r\nAs it states at [http://www.philosophyofmind.info/mindbrainidentity.html philosophyofmind.info]: \"for every mental state there is a brain-state with which it is identical.\"\r\n\r\nThe main support for mind-brain identity theory is the phenomenon of localization.

Everyone seems to think there is no agreement in this field whatsoever on much of anything.  I believe not only is there some significant amount of scientific consensus in this field, I believe there is a revolution taking place as we speek in what the majority of experts believe is the best theories of consciousness.  The only problem is, nobody has yet tried to look for or measure any of this in any kind of rigorous way so nobody knows about such yet.\r\n\r\nCanonizer.com is being developed by a grass roots group of volunteers as a collaborative tool to enable just this.  It is a kind of wiki system with \'camps\' and survey capabilities.  Experts can \'join\' camps to help improve them in comparison to competing camps.  The goal is to first collaboratively develop and negotiate concise statements of the most well accepted theories (and terminology to describe such) in an always progressing way, then to quantitatively measure who thinks which of these theories are the best, and finally to rank experts using a peer ranking process (see: http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81) to quantitatively determine who are the experts to enable the measurement of consensus amongst said experts (as compared to the general population, PhDs, Christians, Atheists,... and other ways which are also possible at canonizer.com for comparison purposes.)\r\n\r\nI believe having a rigorous and comprehensive survey representation of the best theories of consciousness that focuses on what people agree on, rather than what everyone does not agree on (as seems to be the case in the literature today) would be a real boon.  Not only would such enable us to concicely state what the most well accepted theories were, we would be able to see revolutions in fields ocure as they were happening.  I would expect that seeking to measure scientific consensus of this field of study would be well within the goals and purposes of ASSC as it seeks to promote the scientific study of consciousnesses?\r\n\r\nWe are looking to colaberate with anyone interested in such a  project.  For example, would there be any kind of research grant money that anyone might be interseted in providing to help with such a project?  We\'re also working on an academic paper arguing for the importance of such, and describing the methodologies we are using.  We\'d like to get something like this paper published in the ASSC journal Psyche.  Would such be appropriate and possible?\r\n\r\nWe\'ve already made significant progress and a growing number of experts like John Smythies, Steven Lehar, Jonathan Edwards and others are already contributing to the process.  Two example topics that have a good start at showing some significant (even if only early and not yet comprehensive) consensus are these:\r\n\r\n* http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88   Theories of Consciousness\r\n* http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/23   The Hard Problem of Consciousness\r\n\r\nBut of course any survey is only as valuable as the number of people that take the survey.  We would love to know concisely and quantitatively what all experts in this field think we do and do not know about consciousness going forward as ever more scientific data comes in.  Personally, I think this field of study is about to make THE greatest scientific discovery of all time.  And I believe a significant amount of THE ONE true theory that predicts this science of Mind might already be out there.  Wouldn\'t it be great to rigorously watch as everyone converts to THE ONE true theory as it happens?\r\n\r\nWe would of course love to have any thoughts or recommendations any of you might have on any of this.\r\n\r\nUpward,\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n\r\n','2009-05-24 19:35:17','2009-05-24 19:35:17'),(329,1,46,'Robin,\r\n\r\nThanks for your participation towards insuring we accurately represent what everyone believes.

We know this because, in the example you gave, unilateral dichromats can tell us that things look different depending on which eye they use. If the information processing were the same in the neural pathway from each eye it would be impossible for them to make such a distinction. In other words, the information passing from the visual cortex to the auditory cortex must differ as a result of the change in order for the change to be noticed and commented on. This goes against the contention that qualia and information can somehow be separated.

Supervenience is a way whereby two ontologically distinct\r\nentities can be related.\r\n<<\r\n\r\nThe word \"supervene\" is totally meaningless in this context, although I acknowledge that it is commonly misused for this purpose. To supervene is like to intervene, it is just something that happens \"on top of\" or \"after\" something else, instead of \"between\" as in intervene. To say that experience \"supervenes\" on the mechanism of the brain (or whatever) is nothing but word salad.\r\n\r\nNow I acknowledge that Davidson (1970) introduced the term to propose that conscious experience is neither in the brain, where it is caused by brain processes, nor is it out in the world where we experience it to be, but it \"supervenes\" on the brain in some mysterious way that re-locates it to some unspecified dimension where it is undetectable by physical means. This theory is no different than saying that experience exists in the immortal soul that exists in a spiritual dimension that is inaccessible to scientific scrutiny. This is not a scientific hypothesis, but an article of faith, because it is impossible in principle to ever falsify.\r\n\r\nThe concept of supervenience as any kind of explanation for conscious experience is soundly refuted in this section of my paper,\r\n\r\nSpirituality, Supervenience, and Other Nomological Danglers.\r\n\r\nhttp://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html#DANGLERS\r\n\r\nfrom which I quote:\r\n\r\nQuote >>\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Cartesian dualism, there are two key objections to this argument. In the first place the disconnection between the experiential mind and the physical brain is itself merely a hypothesis, whose truth remains to be demostrated. It is at least equally likely prima facie that the mind does not supervene on the brain, but that mind is identically equal to the functioning of the physical brain. In fact, this is by far the more parsimonious explanation, because it invokes a single explanans, the physical brain, to account for the properties of both mind and brain. After all, physical damage to the brain can result in profound changes in the mindâ€”not just the information content of the mind, nor just observed behavior, but brain damage can produce profound changes in the experiential, or \"what it is like\" aspect of conscious experience. The simplest explanation therefore is that consciousness is a physical process taking place in the physical brain, which is why it is altered by physical changes to the physical brain. \r\n\r\nBut the problem of supervenience is more serious than just the argument of parsimony. For if the properties of mind were indeed disconnected from the properties of the physical brain, this would leave the mental domain completely disconnected from the world of reality known to science, what Feigl (1958) has called a \"nomological dangler.\" For if the properties of mind are not determined by the properties of the physical brain, what is it that determines the properties of the mind? ...\r\n\r\nWe now know that the dimensionality of color experience relates directly to the physiology of color vision, i.e. it relates to the fact that there are three different cone types in the human retina, and to the opponent color process representation in the visual cortex. The dimensions of color experience therefore are not totally disconnected from the properties of the physical brain as suggested by Davidson, but in fact phenomenal color experience tells us something very specific about the properties of the representation of color in the physical brain. \r\n\r\nIn fact the only epistemology that is consistent with the modern materialistic world view is an identity theory (Russell 1927, Feigl 1958) whereby mind is identically equal to physical patterns of energy in the physical brain. To claim otherwise is to relegate the elaborate structure of conscious experience to a mystical state beyond the bounds of science. \r\n\r\n<< Quote\r\n\r\nI begin with the initial assumption that what is real, is what is physically detectable and verifiable by scientific means. This is a paradigmatic prejudice of mine, an assumption with which I come to the debate in the first place. I believe that conscious experience is real, and that means it exists in some form that is detectable to science. If you don\'t share my paradigmatic assumption, then there is nothing further to debate. One cannot usefully debate opposing paradigms any more than one can debate the existence of the soul, as long as it is defined as undetectable in principle by physical means.  To accept the \"truth\" of supervenience is to throw up one\'s hands in defeat, and give up even *trying* to find consciousnes in the physical world by declaring it to exist in an undetectable dimension. I am not ready to give up so early, before we have even hardly started. And I firmly believe (yes, it is a faith) that there will eventually be a scientific explanation for conscious experience, just as there was for life, and living things, in terms of the physical world known to science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2009-06-23 15:04:55','2009-06-23 15:04:55'),(348,1,53,'Hi Brent,\r\n\r\n>>>>\r\nAnd, Steve, from what I here you saying, you (and all others that agree with your corollary paragraph) need to convert to the â€œNature has ineffable phenomenal properties campâ€ where all of us agree with you on this issue, and you are not supporting what we disagree with. \r\n<<<<\r\n\r\nAm I in the wrong camp AGAIN?

Was it not obvious that this camp was closer to your beliefs?

Especially when you say such things as: \"it is impossible... to communicate between individuals\" these qualities?\r\n\r\nThese qualophobes,  if you ask me, are the biggest problem, the most obviously wrong, and the key reason as to why we haven\'t discovered qualia before now.  All the \'nuts and bolts\' researchers are looking for the wrong thing, in the wrong place, or not looking at all.  Once we adequately communicate to them, will they not easily demonstrably discover what qualia are and develop ways to eff the ineffable, using your work and such?\r\n\r\nI think we need to be very careful not say things like they cannot be comunicated, and stress the idea predicted by our theory, that phenomenal qualities can be communicated by merging them into one mind where they can all be experienced or phenomenally observed at once - i.e. effing the ineffable.  Also, I think it is very important that we consider Chalmers, Stathis, and all others in qualia camps as great allies against these, in my mind desperately need to be shown the error of their obviously mistaken ways, qualophobes.  (That is the reason for POV hierarchy, so we can show how much we do agree on, rather than just quibbling over much less significant differences.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSteve, I do think you make a powerful argument, that is why I am in your camp, but I think Chalmers, and Stathis also  make very powerful argument which I don\'t think you\'ve fully addressed yet.  This \'transmigration\' idea is basically the idea that if you take a neuron (or set of neurons or whatever) which represents the volume element (or voxel) which currently has the red phenomenal property representing a spot on the surface of a strawberry, and replace this with a set of transistors that is producing the same identical down stream responses, then it must be the same, with the same qualia, since even if you ask it if the spot is the same as the rest of the strawberry after the substitution, it must respond the same as it did before the identically responding corelate neuron was replaced.\r\n\r\nSo there appears to be a conundrum, with both sides having very powerful arguments.  Stathis believes the one argument is more convicting, while we believe your arguments are more important.\r\n\r\nBut, not only do I think the arguments Steve is making are very powerful, I also think there is a critical flaw with this transmigration argument.  I drafted an early statement arguing this point in the [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/79/2 Transmigration Fallacy Camp.]  But this was done some time ago and I obviously need to  improve it and make it more clear and concise.\r\n\r\nIt is basically the idea that if only a particular neural correlate is the only thing that is phenomenally \'red\' - then when you replace it with a transistor set, the transistor will not be able to present the same phenomenal property into the unified world of awareness, since it simply is not fundamentally or phenomenally like the neural correlate.  And because our theory predicts the system will be aware of this difference, it will be unable to produce, to the entire aware system, the same downstream results.  Any downstream results must be a result of this awareness between such phenomenal differences, allowing us to choose the red strawberry over the very different green (or transistor) representation.  Since it will be obvious to the mind that the transistor simply is not fundamentally and phenomenally the same as the original neural correlate the same downstream behavioral results will be impossible.\r\n\r\nSteve, is there anything in the [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/23/2 Nature has ineffable phenomenal properties camp] that is keeping you from changing to this camp?

It is a condensed version of endless debates I\'ve had of this nature on this topic\r\n\r\nhttp://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/cartoonepist/cartoonepist.html\r\n\r\n) I find it curious how people like you begin the debate about mind-brain identity with the **initial assumption** that it is NOT an identity, and could not possibly be an identity, and that it seems to you to be a logical contradiction to state that mind and brain activity are one and the same thing. You just cannot grok that concept ***even as a theoretical possibility***, its like I was trying to convince you that black is white, or up is down.  Thats like debating with someone on the existence of God, who begins with an initial unshakable assumption that God DOES exist, and will not even consider the possibility that he may be mistaken.  This is the paradigm thing! And this is why debates like this typically go round and round in useless circles.\r\n\r\nAs I state in my Response to Commentaries on my Gestalt Isomorphism paper\r\n\r\n( http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/response.html )\r\n\r\n>>>>\r\nIf alternative paradigms are to be fairly evaluated, it is necessary to temporarily and provisionally suspend one\'s own paradigmatic assumptions, (a feat that many find impossible to do) and accept the assumptions of the alternative paradigm as if they could actually be true. Only then can the competing paradigms be fairly compared, not on the basis of the perceived incredibility of their initial assumptions, but on the overall coherence and self-consistency of the world view that they implicate in total.\r\n<<<<\r\n\r\nI would be happy to continue this debate only if you begin by agreeing that WE DON\'T KNOW whether mind and brain are one and the same, or whether mind is something OTHER than the mere activity of the brain. Both theories are logical possibilities, the choice between them should be made based on reason and available evidence, not on the perceived incredibility of one or the other view. But you have to SERIOUSLY ENTERTAIN THE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU MAY BE MISTAKEN before we can usefully continue, otherwise, as I said also in my Response to Commentaries...\r\n\r\n>>>>\r\nUnfortunately many of the commentators failed to grasp the paradigmatic nature of the proposal and uselessly restated their own paradigmatic assumptions as if they were plain fact\r\n<<<<\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I have done the same.

And it was only by temporary suspension of my own belief (which was not easy to do) that I ever came to consider the alternative, which allowed me to discover the overall coherence and self-consistency of the world view that it implicates in total. \r\n\r\nIt never became any less incredible after I discovered its truth, it still remains incredible to me, given current understanding of neurophysiology, that my brain can construct a world with the degree of vivid detail and structural coherence as the world I see around me now. But science has discovered many incredible things, from the vast scale of the universe, and its genesis from an infinitessimal point, to the emergence of life from inanimate processes. Those facts are just as incredible today as they were when first proposed. But scientific evidence and reason trump perceived incredibility, and that is what gives science the power to discover incredible truths. But you have to entertain the possibility of their possibly being true before you can fairly consider the case from both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2009-06-26 13:56:10','2009-06-26 13:56:10'),(358,1,53,'>>I would be happy to continue this debate only if you begin by agreeing\r\nthat WE DON\'T KNOW whether mind and brain are one and the same, or\r\nwhether mind is something OTHER than the mere activity of the brain.\r\nBoth theories are logical possibilities, the choice between them should\r\nbe made based on reason and available evidence, not on the perceived\r\nincredibility of one or the other view.

We can know everything about bats but we can\'t know that they are conscious, and we can\'t know what their experience is like without being a bat ourselves. We can perhaps guess by analogy with our own consciousness and visual or auditory perception, but a super-intelligent alien who has access to all the same scientific information won\'t be able to do this, whereas it would have no problem with non-conscious objects.

We can know everything about bats but we can\'t know that they are conscious, and we can\'t know what their experience is like without\r\nbeing a bat ourselves.\r\n<<<<\r\n\r\nSo goes the standard argument that we hear again and again. But this is again based on an inverted epistemology. The existence and nature of conscious experience is ALL we can ever really know with any certainty. All else, including the whole world known to science, is merely informed speculation based on that experience. It is not consciousness that we will never fully comprehend, it is that world, viewed only indirectly through the veil of experience, which we can never fully comprehend. Consciousness is something we know very well, as long as we don\'t confuse it with what we are conscious *of*. \r\n\r\nAs for bats, it is true we will never know how the qualia of echolocation feel like. But we DO know that whaver they may be like, one thing we know for sure is that they are disposed in a three-dimensional arrangement, like a theatre set, or diorama, and that theater set is a relatively accurate model of the world surrounding the bat, just as our qualia of color are disposed on the surfaces of a three-dimensional experience of the world. In other words, we can know the information content of the bat\'s experience, which is pretty close to that of our own, all we can\'t see is the qualia with which the bat\'s world of experience is \"painted\". But that\'s not so important, its the information that it carries that is important. \r\n\r\nThe concept of the philosophical \"zombie\" exemplifies most clearly the error of the inverted epistemology. Epistemologically speaking, we know for a fact that consciousness exists in our brain, and by extension, likely in the brains of other people and animals. But if the only tiny corner of the universe that we experience in first-person form, just happens to exhibit this most elaborate and compelling phenomenon of consciousness, what are the odds that consciousness only exists in these places? Ultimately, a scientific understanding of consciousness will require that we endow physical matter or processes with some kind of primal consciousness, otherwise there would be no raw material out of which evolution could have developed human consciousness. If mind is a physical process taking place in the physical mechanism of the brain, that is already PROOF by example that a physical process taking place in a physical mechanism can under certain conditions be conscious. What makes the brain special is not its constituent matter, which is the ordinary matter of atoms and electrons, but it is its complex organization that makes it special. So a simpler organism, in an animal brain, is most likely conscious but in a simpler way, and thus by extension, every particle of matter must carry a tiny spark of self-consciousness. That is why when you collect matter together in just the right way, it exhibits consciousness.\r\n\r\nIf you invert your epistemology from the standard naive view, you have to invert everything else along with it (which is why so few people are ready to entertain this possibility). But having done so, you will find a world that still contains some basic paradoxes, such as why would bare matter have a primal form of consciousness, but in return, you abolish the whole notion of zombies as impossible in principle, and the notion of zombies contains the far more paradoxical property of supposedly walking around without bumping into walls while being totally unconscious! What they mean is an experience that carries all the information content of a normal experience, but in the absence of any qualia as carriers of the experience. But information cannot exist without a carrier to carry it, its like trying to paint a picture without paint. All of the standard paradoxes of consciousness simply disappear when viewed from the right epistemological perspective. As incredible as it may seem that the whole world of experience is inside your head, it is nowhere near as paradoxical as the idea of having experience out in the world beyond your brain, suggested by the naive view, where we somehow project conscious experience out of our head onto the world.','2009-06-27 14:31:43','2009-06-27 14:31:43'),(360,1,53,'I agree with everything you have written in the last post, except the idea that zombies are impossible in principle.

To even consider the theoretical possibility of the existence of  zombies makes a clear statement about one\'s epistemology.\r\n\r\nIn the \"standard\" epistemology, conscious experience is carefully sliced exactly at the level of qualia. Qualia are a part of consciousness, but the solid volumes whose bounding surfaces the color qualia are experienced to \"paint\", are not! When I experience a red sphere, the redness is part of my experience, but the spherical surface on which I see that red color is (supposedly) the sphere itself, not part of your experience. The fallacy of this view is exposed in the case of dreams and hallucinations, where colored surfaces are observed to \"clothe\" volumetric objects which clearly have no objective existence. But there is a significant difference between an experience of pure color, in the abstract, and the experience of color draping the surface of a volumetric object like a sphere, where that color is experienced to be extended throughout the volumetric surface of the experienced object.\r\n\r\nIn the correct epistemology, it is not only the color of the sphere that is experienced, but also its spherical volume, bounded by the volumetric surface extending across some specific region of phenomenal space. The solid volumes are an essential part of the experience of a scene. In fact, those solid volumes are more important for safe navigation through the world, than the colored surfaces by which their surfaces are experienced. It does not really matter whether the bat \"sees\" those surfaces as red, or green, or blue, or in some ineffable quale that we cannot experience. The significant aspect of the bat\'s experience, as for our own, which is most meaningful for its survival, is the perception of the volumetric objects that are delimited by the surfaces that it perceives. The primary, most essential  function of perception is to compute those volumetric objects based on the configuration of their experienced surfaces. To count the volumetric products of those perceptual computations as parts of the objective world, rather than of our own experience, is to discount the most essential and complex portion of the perceptual computation, figuring out the spatial configuration of the world based on sensory input.  THAT is the part of the \"vision problem\" that continues to elude vision scientists, but THAT is the part which is most essential for a real solution to the problem. To redefine THAT part of the problem as somehow outside of experience, outside of the realm of the problems to be computed by the brain, is most obviously denied and contradicted by the experience of dreams and hallucinations.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical zombie proposed by philosophers is impossible in principle because it would bump into walls that it does not see, when moving in response to  urges that it does not feel. The whole thing is an absurd concoction erected in a futile attempt to bolster the untenable posits of naive epistemology, that the world that we experience is the world itself, viewed directly, not a replica of that world constructed in our brain.\r\n\r\nIf you have never even HEARD of this challenge to the orthodox view, (and if you are really interested in the true nature of experience, and its computation in the brain) you owe it to yourself to at least learn about this alternative formulation of reality, even if only to ultimately reject it on logical grounds. Its all explained in this book, freely available on-line. All you have to do is read it. If there is something wrong with THAT philosophy then tell me about it, I want to hear it, because I AM truly interested in the true nature of experience, and if there is something fundamentally wrong with MY view, I would indeed be ready to abandon it.\r\n\r\nhttp://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/book2/Boundaries.html\r\n\r\n  Steve Lehar\r\n   ','2009-06-28 15:41:14','2009-06-28 15:41:14'),(363,1,53,'\r\n>>>>\r\nDo you not believe that we will be able to connect human brains with\r\nbat brains with something that can do what the corpus calosum does?

The spatial world is \"painted\" in an invisible spatial quale that distinguishes empty voids from solid matter. Imagine a square cube hanging in space invisibly before you. Polish its imaginary faces with your palms. You can \"know\" the exact boundaries of this imaginary cube, wherever you choose to locate it, so your \"knowledge\" of the cube takes the form of a cube-shaped region of your phenomenal space, in which the \"solid\" interior is experienced in a distinctly different state than the empty void that surrounds it. This is the raw material of the basic spatial quale, and this one underlies all other sensory experience. When you see a cube visually, your mind automatically \"paints in\" the spatial quale corresponding to that cube, filling in not only its visible surfaces, but also its hidden volume and rear faces. \r\n\r\nThe reason why nobody talks about this quale is that naive realists assume it to be the world itself, rather than an experience in your mind, ignoring of course that the spatial quale appears in dreams and hallucinations too.

Since phlogiston, as an obsolete theory of physics proposing a new element that was totally disproved, and thus, cannot have any \"experts\", it  cannot be compared to modern scientific theories of mind -- considered as a medium of information (whether an emergent aspect of or separate from the brain\'s neurology) between phenomenal consciousness and memory, brain, body, senses, etc.  \r\n\r\nAlso, the rhetorical comparing of Einstein\'s \"ether\" (as the \"total space\" and source of all metric spacetime fields) conflated with the earlier (pre-relativity) \"aether theory\" claiming that it was the medium of light -- in order to discredit theories of mind -- is entirely specious and fallacious.  It is also not correct to imply that the ether was disproved -- since the failed MM experiment only proved that the ether was NOT the  medium of light, but did not disprove its existence, according to Einstein, as the primal source of all phenomenal spacetime, as well as light.  Thus, Einstein never disowned the ether -- which can easily be verified by studying his 1920 Leyden Lecture. Therefore, the ether is NOT the medium of light, but IS the light itself that moves through metric spacetime.  And, relativity not only disproved many elements of classical theory, but completely superseded it as an entirely new paradigmatic theory of space, time, gravity, mass-energy, relative motion, etc.\r\n\r\n \r\nAs for the possibility of other dimensions of consciousness, there is no denial...  But to assume that there is only two or three such dimensions, such as  \"observing consciousness,\" \"self reflected consciousness\", and (as I\'ve heard Michael say before) \"psychotic consciousness\" -- all based solely on creationist theories of genesis and revelation in the Biblical scriptures, or on interpretations of religious philosophers such as Krishnamurti or DeCartes -- is totally unsatisfactory, from a scientific or philosophical POV ... And, which appears to to be an obvious attempt to give credence to creationist theories of the origin of consciousness -- without any empirical proof or logical argument concerning the possible spatial or physical origin of consciousness.  \r\n\r\nNor, is there any rationale offered in these assumptions for the examination of the possible natural basis for the existence of consciousness, as well as its function on multiple dimensions equivalent to the altered states of consciousness observed by Western and Eastern scientists and philosophers.  Even dream consciousness would have to be thoroughly explained in any valid \"science of consciousness\" -- which would also have to cover the actual mechanisms of consciousness to be considered as any sort of expertise.\r\n \r\nHowever, there wouldn\'t be a problem in considering Michael  as an expert in this topic, if such a supernatural consciousness theory had a separate \"observer consciousness\" topic of its own, or a position statement in whatever camp under whatever topic Michael chooses to expound his ideas in.  But I would warn all scientific or philosophical \"thinkers\" to be aware of the unverifiable creationist underpinning of these beliefs.\r\n\r\nHowever, such a multidimensional concept of consciousness, while having no rational or scientific basis, may still have an application in studies in transpersonal or cognitive  psychology.  So, there is no reason for it not to appear under any topic specifically applicable to those subjects.  Nevertheless, I do not think Michael\'s creationist theories of consciousness belong under any scientifically or philosophically oriented topic that primarily is concerned with the study of both access and phenomenal consciousness and their interrelationship with mind, memory, brain-body, neuromuscular system, sensory system, etc.  Therefore, since Michael\'s consciousness theory doesn\'t fall under any of those areas of expertise, perhaps it should have its own topic heading or a camp under any general topic concerned with different theories of consciousness -- whether scientific or otherwise.  \r\n\r\nAs it stands, however there cannot be any \"expert\" on consciousness based on creationist or revelatory principles, not can there be a \"science of consciousness\" without the possibility of empirical proof, falsification or verifiable prediction, or even rational explanation of origin and mechanism  Although there should be no objection to the term \"philosophy of consciousness\" to describe such creation based theories of consciousness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, from my personal point of view, I don\'t think that Michael can justifiably call his theory a \"science of consciousness\" -- since there is nothing  in it that can scientifically, or even logically or rationally explain the origin cause and nature of consciousness -- as pure subjectivity, or as self reflected phenomena that is somehow genetically  or dependently interconnected with the overall total space and its material forms.  Nor can it explain the actual informational and physical mechanisms of informational  transformation and transmission that function between phenomenal consciousness (awareness, will, experiencing qualia, perceiving, discerning, discriminating, differentiating, integrating, thinking, ideating, intuiting, recollecting, remembering, reasoning, selecting, choosing, deciding, intending, creating, composing, acting, etc., etc.) and the media of mind-memory and brain between the body, senses, and the outer 3-dimensional world.  \r\n\r\nSo, in context of Michael\'s creationist theory of consciousness, that admittedly challenges the \"scientific method\" as well as the \"thinker\" (neither of which, incidentally, makes any claim to be \"the source of *all* truth\") -- the phase \"science of consciousness\" would appear, in this case, to be an oxymoron.  \r\n\r\nLenny\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn Nov 15, 2008, at 11/15/087:00 PM, canonizer@canonizer.com wrote:\r\n\r\nMichael has sent this message to all the supporters of the Agreement camp on the topic: Mind Experts.\r\n\r\nRather than reply to this e-mail (which only goes to canonizer@canonizer.com) please post all replies to the camp forum thread page this message was sent from here:\r\nhttp://canonizer.com/thread.asp/81/1/1\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response to Lenny, I guess I would have to say \"How can there be any\r\n\"mind\" expert? \r\n\r\nWhich I would consider to be approximately equivalent to the question\r\n\"How can there be any phlogiston expert\"? \r\n\r\nThe assertion that \"To be an expert about anything, one has to think\r\nabout how that thing works\" is, of course, traceable to self-reflection\r\nand the thought of the \'thinker\' as the source of the scientific method\r\nand *all* truth.

In accordance with\r\nOccam\'s Razor, there are thoughts as one particular dimension of\r\nconsciousness; one of those thoughts being the thought of the\r\n\'thinker\'. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the assertion that I am suggesting that all researchers of\r\nthe \'classical\' consciousness or the consciousness of the \'thinker\'\r\nsimply be eliminated is categorically untrue; for the same reason that\r\nrelativity theory was not a *replacement* for classical physics but was\r\nmerely a \'range of applicability\' paradigm change. \r\n\r\nThat is, all that currently occurs within the rubric of research on\r\ncognitive psychology, neurology, etc. etc. etc. could very well be\r\nconsidered to be under to topic of \"mind\" experts (if that\'s what you\r\nwant to call it, it\'s no skin off my back) or the \'classical\'\r\nconsciousness or whatever else you would like to term it. \r\n\r\nI am NOT suggesting that all of this research and this perspective be\r\neliminated *at all*; only that a category be established which\r\nacknowledges that there are, in fact, *3* rather than only one (the\r\n\'thinker\' or the \'mind\') dimension of consciousness. (And, if the\r\nconsciousness of the \'thinker\' wants to deny the reality of both the\r\n\'unconscious\' and the \"observing consciousness\"; that, too, is fine by\r\nme; just so long as another category is established in which all of\r\nthese dimensions of consciousness *can* be acknowledged.) \r\n\r\nUsing Lenny\'s rationale, I suppose the Michelson-Morley experiment and\r\nEinstein\'s relativity as well should be either \"expelled\" from any\r\ndiscussion on physics or \"ignored\" because they challenge the existence\r\nof the \"ether\". \r\n\r\nIt seems that such comments demonstrate just how close this society is\r\ncoming to the official institution of \"thought police\". \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease report any abuse to support@canonizer.com.\r\n\r\n','2009-06-29 18:33:42','2009-06-29 18:33:42'),(368,1,88,'Lenny,\r\n\r\nThanks for starting this thread up again.  This is perfect timing since I\'ve recently finally had time to implement a draft of a \'mind experts\' canonizer algorithm based on this topic.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some time ago, Michael removed all his contributed content, removed all his support, and communicated to me that he was no longer interested in participating in any way.\r\n\r\nOf course, the web site running at http://canonizer.com is the main released and working version we are using.  But there is another mirror backup or development version running on http://test.canonizer.com.  You can now go to this test version and check out the new system implementing the new expert algorithm based on what has been canonized on this topic to date.  (If the main system is ever down or overloaded, there is a chance this backup version may be up, but be careful since the test system is not as stable since it is where development and testing is done.)\r\n\r\nOn that test system, the new algorithm is currently named the \"consciousness experts\" algorithm, and you can select it to quantitatively measure scientific consensus so we can rigorously measure and track this going forward.  Unless there are any objections, I\'ll probably change the name from consciousness expert to \'mind expert\' to match the name of this topic.  If anyone has feelings one way or another, please bring such up here as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first draft of this algorithm currently uses two passes.  First it does a one person one vote to get things seeded, then it makes a second pass to measure what these general population determined experts think by themselves relative to each other.  When you select this expert algorithm on this mind experts topic here, it necessarily works different than all other topics, since it is reflecting on itself in a recursive way.  On this topic only, the scores given to each supporter of a camp are determined by the first pass / one person one vote canonization.  Then these are added up for all experts in each camp for a total camp score for each expert.  This resulting second pass total score is the score that each expert gets for all other camps supported in other topics when this expert canonizer algorithm is selected.  So in other words, \'\'\'when you canonize this topic with this algorithm selected on the side bar, the points listed for each expert camp is the number of \'votes\' each mind expert will get on all other \'camps\' they support in any of the other topics.\'\'\'\r\n\r\nThere is also currently a significant penalty being added to the first pass for people that only \'vote\' for or support themselves.  In other words, if you vote for more than one person, your top vote has more value than if you only vote for yourself.  Currently many experts are only voting for themselves, so this is to add motivation to voting for more than just one\'s self.  In other words, if you are only voting for yourself, you will get much more bang for your vote if you vote for more than one person, and we  encourage everyone to do this.  (When you \'join\' a second camp, it takes you to an ordering page where you can specify your desired order and each successive choice has half as much of your vote.)\r\n\r\nOf course, as always, we\'d love any feedback or ideas on ways to do things better and / or help with anything in any way.  We\'ll be renaming stuff, documenting how all this works in the appropriate topics, installing it on the live system, and so on, over the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all your continued support!\r\n\r\nUpward,\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n','2009-06-30 01:49:28','2009-06-30 01:49:28'),(369,1,53,'\r\nSteve,\r\n\r\nI\'ve heard you talk about transparent qualia like this before, and I\'ve been pondering and studying this theory more since you\'ve posted this info here.

What justifies the a priori denial?\r\n\r\nIn addition, thinking ahead,  even an improved model or theory of consciousness, once it emerges,  will  carry it\'s own weight rationally without needing such artificial or prejudicial subsidies.  Try it. Imagine the camp statement is simply deleted.   Writers are faced even more with presenting crisp, clear statements and images -- rather than languishing behind positions, doctrine  and dogma  \r\n\r\nThe statement, as written, is inaccurate. Some \"supernatural\" influences and impinging factors obviously exist or weigh in having some bearing on consciousness, content of consciousness, and the history of conscious influences as well as influencing modes and patterns of thought and thinking. As well, a fairly large number of potential canonizer participants - many people - currently have strong relationships within at least one of the world\'s seven or eight  major belief systems. \r\n\r\nI suggest that the actual objective tally shows that about 12 canonizer participants are in the \"Not supernatural\" camp whereas some several billion potential participants are in the \"Not not supernatural\" camps.  And supernaturality, when it comes to presenting an improved  trial theory on the rational workings of consciousness, is a red(ness) herring -- it\'s not relevant except to reveal one camp\'s fears and insecurities.  \r\n\r\nConsider it as simple way to make the canonizer inappropriately ineffective -- to  block discussion by inserting someone\'s pet issue in the wrong place. \r\n\r\nToward this end, I have recently started the \"Consciousness is structurally coded\" alternate main branch which innately supports scientific models that can be described moderately well in clear and rational (or perhaps analog or super-rational) terms.  The camp statement speaks of it being \"NOS - not otherwise specified,  wrt to supernatural\".   The \"structural coding\" imagery draws some linkages to the the structural coding in the genetics and the epi-genetics, and, the emerging model where there is persistent multi-value logic structural coding in the 10^20 tetrahedral-like water molecules per second  forming at respiration sites  within humans. (Rates may be different within other creatures.)\r\n\r\nOn the surface, I am or  might be attracted to the \"representational and real\" camp  or at least toward my sense of those two words.  Yet, to me that camp is crouching behind the \"Not Supernatural\" subsidy or dogma, and within, it seems to hold that neurons and qualia are primary.\r\n\r\nOver in the new, rational and scientific \"Consciousness is structurally coded\" main branch,  my vote is currently for (not surprisingly)  implementing the dynamic structural coding in the streams of the 10^20 water molecules per second coming in respiration forming the internal analog language.\r\n  \r\nAn alternate \"structural coding\"  apparently is or would be  structural coding the neurons or neurons/synapses/dendites, and perhaps making an analogous case for persistent in those processes.  \r\n\r\nIn any event,  I\'d appreciate hearing others\' views  on deleting the \"Not supernatural\" camp.  \r\n\r\nRalph Frost','2009-07-14 05:29:32','2009-07-14 05:29:32'),(375,1,46,'I would object most strongly to removal of the \"not supernatural\" proviso. Speaking for myself, the pursuit of a scientific, physical, natural explanation for consciousness is exactly what I believe to be the only reliable path to discovering the real truth behind conscious experience.\r\n\r\nTo claim that consciousness has *ANY* supernatural component whatsoever is to end the search before we have hardly gotten started! Because once we accept a supernatural component, there is no need to search further, the answer has already been \"found\", and it has been \"found\" in a hidden dimension of un-reality which can never be proven or disproven, only \"believed\" (or NOT!). \r\n\r\nIf science had given in to the *animists* of the last century, who claimed that life itself had an \"elan vital\", a vital essence beyond scientific scrutiny, then we would never have discovered the biochemical explanation for life. If we had succumbed to the medieval belief that sickness and disease were caused by evil spirits, we would never have discovered germs and viruses. If we had accepted the notion that the heavenly bodies are pushed around the skies by supernatural creatures, we would never have discovered orbital dynamics. Because there would have been no need to search further! The (non-)answer had already been found! And the \"answer\" is \"look no further, there\'s no point, you won\'t find anything!\"\r\n\r\nThe outstanding success of the enlightenment, and rational thinking in materialist terms, in solving so many of the deepest, most perplexing mysteries of the universe which had proven so resistant to explanation for centuries, has convinced many of us that a rational, enlightened, scientific explanation will ultimately explain consciousness also, as a physical process taking place in the physical mechanism of the brain.\r\n\r\nJust because the majority of humanity, and even a frighteningly large number of scientists, believe in some supernatural nonsense or other, is no reason for us rationalists to abandon our reason just to follow the crowd, especially given the fact  that NO supernatural forces or entities, whether Gods or spirits, mental telepathy or  telekinesis, have EVER been demonstrated to exist ANYWHERE, despite centuries and centuries of intense effort to prove otherwise. \r\n\r\nHow do objective, open-minded people \"agree\" what consciousness is not, prior to working out what consciousness is? What justifies the a-priori denial is the DISMAL FAILURE of centuries of mystical mumbo-jumbo at predicting or explaining ANYTHING, stacked against centuries of the enlightement seemingly finding an explaination for virtually EVERYTHING by the scientific method! \r\n\r\nThis is not \"languishing behind positions, doctrine, and dogma\" (!) Quite to the contrary!

Having trusted in and been changed through faith in the message in the bible and in the supernatural  healing power of Jesus Christ, over time I have done enough experiments and observed enough change, in myself and other \"believers\", to convince me that holding and developing the one particular thought or belief can and does influence cognition, character development and behavior. Thought influences thought; some thoughts more than others. Can I explain or prove Christianity scientifically, to your liking?  No, not all that well.   Items of faith are extracurricular in that way.  That is what the word \"faith\" is all about.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondly,  following on one of Steve\'s suggestions, at the James Randi, site, their FAQ states:\r\n\r\n    >2.2 What is the definition of â€œparanormalâ€ in regards to the \r\n    >       Challenge?\r\n\r\n     >     Websterâ€™s Online Dictionary defines â€œparanormalâ€ as â€œnot \r\n     >     scientifically explainable; supernatural.â€ \r\n\r\nIf we face facts, presently consciousness is not scientifically explainable and thus it already IS supernatural!   I mean, the situation is consciousness is an anomaly, it\'s not accounted for or seen as an issue   within the currently dominant scientific paradigm.  We face, therefore, developing an alternate scientific paradigm -- with different tenets and a more general expression -- which also  provides some reasonable supports for one or more trial scientific theories descriing the what\'s and how\'s of consciousness.   Shifting paradigms, seeing the unseen and describing what previously has no description is not a straightforward, rational process. It minimally borders on the supernatural and the extremely rarely repeating (aka, lacking in scientific repeatability; untestable) events. \r\n\r\nSo, if you catch the drift,  agreeing that there is a \"natural, scientific description for  consciousness\", or  as Brent wrote about the earlier discussion: \'consciousness is scientifically approachable or testable\' seems rational and reasonable enough, particularly among a group with the stated goal of grokking  improved scientific theories of consciousness.   \r\n\r\nGoing the next step out to claiming consciousness is not supernatural, when by present dictionary accounts consciousness presently IS supernatural -- lacking a scientific description -- strikes me as coming from a highly energized but highly emotional,  irrational place within a person.   There are more beliefs supporting that belief.\r\n\r\nIt might be helpful to unearth those deeper motivations and evaluate whether those  motives really apply in this scientific endeavor.  If the threat of one or a few people leaving is resting on, say, a deep-seated resentment due to one or more slights or abuses by, say, \"religious people\", or perhaps a commitment to the tenets of New Age or one of the other major world belief systems, then it seems appropriate to unearth and present that actual underlying belief clearly in the canonizer hierarchy -- to get the categories straight.   \r\n\r\nAlong this line. consider also the natural rule that \"for every re-action, there is an equal and opposite action\" and then re-consider the sentiment and strength of  \"Not supernatural\".  The entire camp statement can be deleted (or revised) with no ill effects, assuming that the actual task, developing an improved scientific theory, is carried forward.\r\n\r\nOtherwise or related, Brent, you also included the phrase: \"I think it is very likely that very similar POV structures could form underneath the supernatural vs not supernatural main branches\".\r\n\r\nI would like to point out that it looks to me like you are seeing through the traditional \"either/or\" binary logic where you are thinking since you already have a \"Not supernatural\" branch that a competing branch can only be in the \"Is supernatural\" category.  The perspective I hold and which is presented in the camp statement for the alternate main branch of \"Consciousness is structurally coded\", is the new branch is \"NOS - not otherwise specified\" with respect to the supernatural. Consider it from a multi-state logic perspective.  Also, stating IS/not supernatural, before the development of a preliminarily functional trial theory is simply pre-mature.  It\'s irrelevant.  Do the real  job first and the characteristic ought to sort out and be self-evident.  \r\n\r\nI believe the direct route through the woods is to  hammer out the new paradigm and the new scientific trial theory of consciousness first: to  focus attention on getting the structural coding working first. \r\n\r\nAs for: \"I\'m just curious if you would support a camp that stated everything about consciousness is approachable via the scientific method.\",  I\'d generally agree, probably would hedge on the absolute of \"everything\", but, this seems pretty self-evident if you are aiming at a scientific model. \r\n\r\nI\'m beginning to get the impression that I sometimes am thinking differently than other people particularly when I reflect on the underlying principle of structured duality supporting an underlying multi-state, or multi-value logic structurally coded system which, for our introductory purposes supports the structural coding we see in the genetics, epi-genetic and now in  the 10^20 molecules per second flux of ordered water  being created in our respiration sites, coincident with our experience.    If you notice, all this structural coding is happening in a moderately coherent and somewhat connected manner at a level of organization, and energy level below and prior to, say, structural coding in the secondary neural/synaptic/dendrite level. Plus the new model is pretty compact with a good information compression ratio.  \r\n\r\nIt would be different to have people agree with the new branch or my specific entry in it.  I\'d welcome all the agreement I can get.  Like you said, Brent, the new branch does open a way for  alternate structural codings, I\'d see it it as along the neural lines, or the dendritic lines but inheriting the genetic and epi-genetic structural coding cnnections in their own specific ways. \r\n\r\nI agree, though, it would be good to  have a few more participants. \r\n\r\nOutward...\r\nRalph Frost\r\n\r\n\r\n','2009-07-15 19:29:52','2009-07-15 19:29:52'),(379,1,46,'refrost,\r\n\r\nI like what you have to say about religion.  More than any other scientific issue, the nature of the \'soul\' seems to be more critical to the core of any religion than anything.  Most people try to separate religion from science in their minds.  I think not only is this a problem, but the many diverse places people draw the lines of separation, is also problematic.  So many people draw the line way too broadly, excluding qualia and everything, and any time it crosses that line, they refuse to even listen to anything about such in a \'la la la la - I\"m not going to listen to this\' way.\r\n\r\nBut if we can classify and concisely state just what people think about these issues, precisely state where different people draw the line, why, and so on - and then rigorously and quantitatively measure who is in what camp on all these issues, I think that will be of infinite value - and finally allow much more critical communication - especially between diverse camps.\r\n\r\nTo me, \'not supernatural\' and \'scientifically demonstrable / understandable\' are the same thing.  So I have a hard time understanding people that distinguish between these two ideas.  The idea that something is not understandable (and consequently not reliably fixable / improvable) is just a terrible faithless idea to accept as true - and I see no rational evidence that says we must give up faith and hope and accept any such terrible notion.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of diverse doctines contained in all these camps:\r\n* scientifically understandable\r\n* perception is representational\r\n* primacy of qualia\r\n\r\nand so on.  When you break things down into a tree structure, you must decide which one is most important to divide things up at the highest levels.  In my opinion, the above ordering is the best order of what is most important.\r\n\r\nYou\'ve stated some great reasons for why you are interested in starting a new branch, and possibly pushing towards restructuring things.  I think it would be great to include concise statements of what your beliefs (in particular in contrast to the current consensus camps) are, and why you think a different structure is better.  You could say much of what you\'ve been telling us in the [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/26 Consciousness is structurally coded] camp.  That would enable people that are thinking similar to you to find you and your camp, and it would enable us in different camps to better know what your desires are, and better enable us to keep them in mind as we also make judgments about how to improve things to better capture concisely and quantitatively what everyone believes.\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n','2009-07-16 02:26:44','2009-07-16 02:26:44'),(380,1,46,'Brent,\r\n\r\nThank you for your replies and suggestions. \r\n\r\nWhere you wrote:\r\n\r\n\"To me, \'not supernatural\' and \'scientifically demonstrable / understandable\' are the same thing. So I have a hard time understanding people that distinguish between these two ideas. The idea that something is not understandable (and consequently not reliably fixable / improvable) is just a terrible faithless idea to accept as true - and I see no rational evidence that says we must give up faith and hope and accept any such terrible notion.\"\r\n\r\nI  believe the difficulties in understanding arise basically from differences in the object of one\'s faith. Faith in reason, science or self, or,say, a new age-like sense of faith in self gets or places a person in one perspective. Faith in a particular, \"other\" spiritual relationship, gets or places one in another perspective.  The two perspectives are not equal and thus differences in understanding naturally emerge. \r\n\r\nLet\'s say, for instance that you have 100% of your faith in science accounting for  100% of everything 100% accurately,  whereas I have faith that science is a good and periodically changing, helpful approximation of much of our  situation and experience, but simply not up to 100% of  100% of everything. Say, just for example that out about ninety levels of organization in the so-called multi-verse, there is yet another  impenetrable boundary  which influences that which is within the boundary in discernible, yet unknowable and unpredictable ways.  Not 100%.  Let\'s say there is strongly repeating stuff, stochastically repeating stuff, and then rare and very very very, rare -- way beyond our regular experience stuff.  Benevolent broken symmetries that just appear, but do so in the nick of time, so to speak, facilitating the growth of one individual or of all of humanity out into the so-called cosmos.\r\n\r\nIt is from that sort of awesome perspective of the creation which the approximate tool of science gives us that reasonable people do not  see or agree that  \'not supernatural\' and \'scientifically demonstrable / understandable\'  are equal.  But, again, this all does go back to what one places in the central position. How we are made, generally, that means self is held by us in the central role and it takes effort -- and a different sort of faith, and usually some awareness/experience of inexplicable events -- to  dislodge ourselves from the self-centered position. \r\n\r\nThe seven or eight major world belief systems generally present different sorts of options on this and the closely related terrain.  \r\n\r\nNow, perhaps \"not supernatural\" means \"not witchcraft\", \"not occult\", \"not paranormal\", or Lord knows what else, to different people in the camp and if so, those might be some other silent calls for more specific expressions, or for the outright deletion, as I advocate, of the ambiguous and thus misleading doctrine.\r\n\r\nAnother perspective to consider on the differences and thus potential difficulties in understanding one perspective from another is in whether one thinks of  scientific theories as absolutes (aka strong, absolute faith in science) or as approximate.    The facts and history of scientific experience reveal that we use the scientific method as though we are hopping from rock to rock in crossing a stream. A model appears and it is useful and general but then is found lacking and replaced or modified into some other model that is a bit more general... until new anomalies are found....  So, minimally,  we\'re passing through various paradigm transitions -- gaps, discontinuities --   in our travel. At the transition, the old model gives out or rusts away as or after the new model materializes, or both, or several, or none hold during the transition. What then?  And from what do ANY of the \"scientific\" models arise?  \r\n\r\nSo there are different conditions in the transitions.  What IS the  term for passing through gaps of \"not scientific\" or  \"Not natural\"?  \r\n\r\nIf you back up a couple of directory levels and move forward one step,  over in the \"Consciousness is structurally coded\" branch  I think it is possible and  to  everyone\'s advantage to simply put forward the various scientific models and avoid hiding behind the ambiguous, pre-mature and unnecessary \"Not supernatural\" doctrine.    \r\n\r\nThink about it. \r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\nRalph Frost\r\n\r\nhttp://structuredduality.blogspot.com\r\n\r\n','2009-07-17 13:11:08','2009-07-17 13:11:08'),(381,1,46,'It is profoundly tragic that people emerge from our educational system with advanced degrees in science, without any understanding of the long centuries of ignorance and misery due to dogmatic faith that predated the enlightenment, and without any understanding of the value of what reason has given to mankind.  I quote from Chapter 11 of my book The Boundaries of Human Knowledge\r\n\r\nhttp://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/book2/Boundaries.pdf\r\n\r\nThe greatest revolution in human knowledge that has led to the outstanding\r\nsuccess of the western world has been the adoption of discovered knowledge as\r\nthe most reliable path toward the truth. The straightest path toward the truth is by\r\nway of eternal skepticism. In previous cultures, and in religion today, the preferred\r\npath has always been revealed knowledge, especially when it concerns questions\r\nof ultimate truth, such as the existence of God, or the purpose of the universe.\r\nThis natural tendency to rely on received knowledge stems from our individual\r\nexperiences as children, when we learn that our parents and teachers are the\r\nmost reliable sources of knowledge; they always seem to know more than we do.\r\nAs we grow to adulthood however, we discover that the experts differ profoundly,\r\nespecially on those same primal questions of ultimate truth. There is a strange\r\nâ€˜catch-22â€™ in the choice between discovered and revealed knowledge. If God did\r\nexist, and created this universe for our benefit, then His word, as recorded in the\r\nBible, would indeed be the most reliable source of Truth. But the only evidence for\r\nthe existence of God is the Bible, whose reliability itself depends on the existence\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nBut there are deeply troubling aspects of this faith in revealed knowledge. If the\r\nBible were indeed the word of the creator of the universe, then why does it fail to\r\nmention those profoundly significant truths which have since been discovered by\r\nscience? Why is there no mention in the Bible of the fact that our physical bodies\r\nevolved from those of the apes? If evolution were the mechanism chosen by God\r\nto create man, why is this most central fact completely absent from the Holy\r\nBook? Why instead are we told a tale of creation through Adam and Eve, a story\r\nwhich is totally inconsistent with scientific fact? Why is there no mention in the\r\nBible of the most profound and earth-shattering fact of the Big Bang? Or of the\r\ncountless billions of other galaxies in the universe, each populated by billions of\r\nstars of which our own sun is but one? Or that all matter is composed of positive\r\nand negative particles, whose powerful attraction to each other make up the\r\nphysical substance of the universe around us? Or even the basic fact that the\r\nearth rotates under the sky, rather than the other way round as it appears to the\r\nnaive observer? Surely these most primal facts of the universe should have been\r\nthe first things presented in Genesis. If God does exist, and wishes us to believe\r\nin Him, why does He make himself completely undetectable by scientific means?\r\nWhy does He choose to reveal Himself through an ancient manuscript of\r\nquestionable origin, full of contradictions, and totally indistinguishable from a\r\nmanuscript written by mortals? If God endowed us with a rational mind, why\r\nwould he require us to abandon our reason on questions of the greatest\r\nconsequence and import? The same argument holds also for the sacred texts of\r\nall other religions and faiths. The very fact that there are multiple mutually\r\ninconsistent faiths is itself proof that no more than one of them can possibly be\r\ntrue. The profound inconsistencies between discovered and revealed knowledge\r\ncast the most profound doubt on the reliability of revealed knowledge as a path\r\ntoward the truth.\r\nFurther grounds for suspicion of revealed knowledge as a path towards the truth\r\ncan be found by observing the systematic differences between the picture of the\r\nworld revealed by religion as contrasted with that revealed by science. Most\r\nreligions provide an anthropocentric view of a God who cares deeply about our\r\nindividual thoughts and feelings. But the history of scientific discovery has been\r\ncharacterized by a regular progression of anthrodecentralization, demoting\r\nhumans from the central position in the universe under the personal supervision of\r\nGod, to lost creatures on the surface of a tiny blip of matter orbiting a very\r\nunremarkable star, among countless billions of stars in an unremarkable galaxy\r\namongst countless billions of other galaxies as far as the telescopic eye can see.\r\nThere is an egocentric, self-aggrandizing aspect to religious belief that suggest an\r\nulterior motive to the world view that it promulgates, elevating man from a lowly\r\nbeast whose existence is a consequence of some cosmic accident, to a noble\r\nsupernatural creature who transcends the animal body that he appears to occupy,\r\nand whose existence on this earth plays a vital role in some great cosmic battle of\r\nforces.\r\nAnother glaring inconsistency in most religious belief is the idea of God as a\r\nperfect being, who advocates love of oneâ€™s neighbor, self-sacrifice, and altruistic\r\ncooperation, while the entire web of life on this planet, supposedly His creation, is\r\ncharacterized by an eternal mortal struggle between competing organisms, from\r\nthe tiniest microscopic competition between microbes, competition between plants\r\nfor sunlight, competition between herbivores for plants, and between predators\r\nand prey, and between different predators for the same pray, desperate struggles\r\nagainst parasites and diseases, all the way to the violent wars of conquest and\r\nannihilation that have characterized human history since time immemorial. Our\r\nvery intelligence and agility and inventiveness are surely a direct product of\r\ncountless millennia of armed struggle with our human and animal enemies, as\r\nevidenced by the fact that to this day, the most dramatic technological and\r\norganizational advances are made at the most rapid rate during times of war and\r\nnational conflict. We have yet to take account of the full implications of Darwinâ€™s\r\ntheory of evolution for the nature of our selves, and our place in the world.\r\nIf religion is so obviously at odds with the observed facts of the universe, why then\r\ndoes it continue to this day to hold so many in its sway? Why is it that so many\r\neven in the modern western world hold to some version of religious, spiritual, or\r\nparanormal belief? The answer to that question is manifold; religion serves a\r\nvariety of diverse functions that benefit both the individual and society as a whole.\r\nIt is only as a path toward real truth that religion is such an abysmal failure.','2009-07-17 13:43:18','2009-07-17 13:43:18'),(382,1,46,'Steve  (slehar)\r\n\r\nYou seem to have a lot of good questions charged with what I get the impression is a lot of very intense  emotion: anger and/or frustration.

Plus,  well, as I said in the other reply,  our different views hinge on  and grow from one\'s initial faith --  what one has faith in.   Latter-day New Agers and others appear to take one   strongly self-centered slant. Other people, sometimes, are able to take another,  accepting being in a servant-vassel relationship and, even though it is a struggle, accepting God in the central position.       \r\n\r\nNot that I expect these words to hold much sway, but,  I do notice that you select one book or set of books and perspectives (guiding your thoughts and impressions)  which have also been handed down from our ancestors.

The problem lies in the fact that most current camps in the physicalist/materialist/not-supernatural camps are based either on the assumption that there is some ghostly aspect to consciousness that can\'t be synthesized by existing science, hence a need to study QM, Dark matter or something exotic, or that there is a 1 to 1 correspondence between brain representations and phenomenal aspects of consciousness. \r\n\r\nTo say that the brain is representative falls into the trap of choosing between one or the other of these camps. Philosophers are having a hey day attacking the 1 to 1 correspondence approach with I think some reason, and the Exotic camps seem to be stuck on regressive approaches which haven\'t changed materially since the homunculus.\r\n\r\nThe representative/Illusary approach explains why there isn\'t a 1 to 1 mapping of representation to Phenomenal aspect of consciousness, and the reason is that the Phenomenal aspect of Consciousness is often simplified by the nature of the control mechanisms that regulate it, so that it seems simpler than the representations actually required to make it work.\r\n\r\nIn other words there are more states of representation than can be detected from conscious phenomena.\r\n\r\nThis is the point of view I hope to promote in the representational/illusary camp.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that it eliminates a major viewpoint that of the 1 to 1 or identity camp. The second camp, the Architectural Illusion camp, represents a suggestion for how to replace the identity camp. Now this camp is controversial in a way that the representative /illusary camp isn\'t.\r\n\r\nWhat it suggests is that there are architectural reasons for the way that the representations are formed, and for the illusions that are formed as a result of simplification for control purposes. Thus a different architecture of mind would not necessarily have the same representative and illusary elements. The differences between the early representational forms, and the Illusary phenomenal might therefore tell us something about the architecture required for the particular phenomenal illusions to exist.\r\n\r\nFinally we come to  my third camp where I present the opinion that consciousness according the architectural Illusary camp, is probably the private preserve of Mammals and Birds. This is based on the idea that the seeds of consciousness probably lie in the architectural changes that were made at the time of the Dinosaur Die-off where birds and Mammals outsurvived many lizard like animals by becoming more flexible. Possibly indicating a role for Omnivorus species in the development of consciousness.

Anyone participating at canonizer is either an expert or not an expert. The probability that a group has an expert is 1:2 or 50% chance. The probability that a group has two experts is 4:1 or 25% chance. It is reasonable to assume that a consensus would require a large group. The larger the group, the lesser the probability that all members are experts. Furthermore, assume that an expert has 100% chance to create a camp for an expert, whereas a non-expert has a chance of 50% to select an expert and 50% to select a non-expert. In a group of eight people our model predicts that half would be experts and half would be non-experts, thus 4 experts and 4 non-experts. The experts choose their camps - selecting 4 experts - and the non-experts choose their camps - selecting 2 experts and 2 non-experts. In a group of 8 our model predicts that there would be 6 (4+2) expert camps and 2 non-expert camps. The probability that a non-expert camp would be selected over an expert camp is 2:6 or 1:3. Our model predicts that every third time a final vote (per group) is cast a non-expert is chosen over an expert. Few scientists would be satisfied with being 67% right. The certitude required for a scientifically valid conclusion on who is an expert has not been met.\r\n\r\nNow, given the more sophisticated Mind Expert algorithm (as it is described [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/53/11here]) the probability would turn out like this:\r\n\r\n* First drawing (by the selecting population): Experts 50%, Non-Experts 50% (of the selected population).\r\n\r\n* Second drawing (by the selected samples): 75% Experts (Experts choice 50% + Non-experts choice 25%), 25% Non-experts (Non-experts choice).\r\n\r\nThe minds behind the Mind Expert algorithm should be applauded for reducing the probability from 1:3 to 1:4. However, 75% is still not enough for a method to be deemed 1) \"scientific\" and 2) \"rigorous\". (1) If someone by the word scientific refers to the opinion of experts, the reasoning above suggests that only half of the opinions may come from experts. (2) A consensus is defined as an \"agreement in the judgement or opinion reached by a group as a whole\" [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=consensus *]. Consensus is not 75 people voting for one option with 25 people disagreeing and voting for another. First when juries or democratic constellations fail to reach a consensus they vote.

But of course this is absurd.\r\n\r\nBefore Einstein, the scientific consensus was in the camp that stated F = M * A, and after Einstein, and some additional scientific testing, everyone jumped to the new camp, for which Einstein was the first lone supporter.  Both before, and after Einstein, most everyone would agree there was a clear scientific consensus about the differing relationships between force, mass, and acceleration.  Your description of this \'model\' is just one of many possible distributions of experts within any group.  And your example distribution, and the related odds, does not apply to either of these two before and after scientific consensus examples.\r\n\r\nOne goal of canonizer.com is simply to measure the above scientific revolution process with as much rigor as possible (with far more rigor than anything to date).  It seeks to definitively document who are the first supporters of \'correct\' theories, before the rest of the sheepish heard shows up, as they are nipped in the heals by the guide dogs of new demonstrable scientific proof.  You want to definitively track this kind of reputation so we can, in the future, create canonization algorithms that give far more weight to the camps of these leading mavericks right?\r\n\r\nSure it isn\'t yet perfect.  You are treating \'consensus\' as a qualitative term, where I normally use it as a quantitative term (Probably given that this is the first open survey tool anywhere close to being capable of rigorously, quantitatively measuring such)  If you are not willing to accept 75% as not being considered a \'consensus\' then might I ask you what percentage would be considered a consensus?  How would you prefer to say something like \"camp X has 51% consensus\"?\r\n\r\nAlso, as of this writing, there are no clear qualophobe camps being represented by any one yet, expert or not, in the topic on [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88  The best theories of consciousness].  In other words, at least for all participators so far, they are all unanimously qualophiles.  I would argue this is a very telling sign, even at this early and still far from comprehensive survey phase.  And that this fact, or how much support there is for each side of this issue,  is currently grossly being misrepresented in the current qualia article on Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nWe recently surpassed more than 20 K published and peer reviewed articles on the topic of consciousness, as documented in Chalmers [http://consc.net/mindpapers Mind Papers Bibliography].  The critical problem is nobody can see any signal (where there is the most consensus) from the noise (where there is no agreement) in all this mostly trash, simply because nobody is yet measuring for such.  A bunch of us believe that if we can make this scientific consensus stand out from all the trash and noise, everyone will finally get the message of why, what, where, and how to scientifically look for qualia.  And once all the sheepish researchers still following Dennet, and the like, finally see this signal standing out from all the 20K pieces of noise, it will finally enable some of them to make what a bunch of us predict will be the greatest and most world changing scientific achievement of all time - the complete theoretical understanding, and demonstrable scientific validation of what we, and our consciousness are.\r\n\r\nBrent\r\n\r\n','2009-09-13 20:01:15','2009-09-13 20:01:15'),(417,116,44,'Stathis\r\n\r\nYou claim \"Whether we say that consciousness supervenes on brain activity or that\r\nconsciousness is identical with brain activity is one of those\r\nterminological discussions that philosophers are fond of but which\r\nmakes no material difference to the question at issue:\"\r\n\r\nThis is not a \'terminological\" issue â€”i.e. an argument about wordsâ€”but it is a matter of fact.

It prompts me to realise that functional equivalence is a matter of degree or context.\r\n\r\nYou can swap a digital for an analogue waveform generator with the same spec: they are functionally equivalent for that purpose. If you convert the digital generator to produce noise, however, the best software can do is produce pseudo-random sequences (ones that repeat) so the output only looks like noise whereas an analogue noise generator produces a genuine random waveform.

It was very inspiring to have a chance to meet him in person, and have the opportunity during down time to talk with him.  As many of you know, he has been included in various e-mail solicitations where some of you found out about and started participating in this survey process.  But at the time, Chalmers wasn\'t interested.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I first went up to meet Chalmers after his presentation, he recognized me.  He said I would be interested to know that he was working on a survey of his own to measure for scientific consensus.  From what he described, his survey will be a traditional \'snapshot\' survey where he writes the questions and the possible answers, and various experts at top ranked philosophical institutions are asked to take the survey.  I think this is great that he is also realizing how important measuring for scientific consensus is in a still controversial field like this one.  And I\'m hoping whatever survey he comes up with, we can get it all \'canonized\' so we can extend it, and find out what more than just the set of experts he chooses to have participate - in comparison to his results.  I bet the results of any such survey will be very surprising and have profound effects on this field, giving the idea of the importance of measuring for consensus a big boost.\r\n\r\nHe also seemed interested when I pointed out how much consensus there was in our small survey here for his \'consciousness arises from anything functionally equivalent\' camp, though he wasn\'t very impressed with the still small sample size.  When I told him I was in a different camp, he was gracious enough to spend some time asking what it was I do believe, and discussing this with me.  This gave me new insights in how I might rewrite the [http://test.canonizer.com/topic.asp/79/2 Transmigration Fallacy] camp statement so it is, I hope, much easier to understand and comprehensively covers the important issues in a more clear way.\r\n\r\nI of course would love to hear any thoughts on this, especially from people that are in this camp, and agree with this position.

For example, given an amino acid sequence, it should be possible to calculate its 3D structure under certain pH and temperature conditions, calculate its conformational change when exposed to particular neurotransmitters, and calculate how this conformational change would alter its permeability to sodium and potassium ions if the protein molecule is embedded in a phospholipid bilayer membrane. In this way, the behaviour of a whole neuron or a whole brain could be modelled by the appropriate computer program. Computationally very difficult, no doubt, but the field of computational neuroscience is devoted to solving such problems.\r\n\r\nNow, it is possible that there will be some aspect of nature that is just not computable, and that neurons rely on this and the behaviour of brains is therefore not computable. For example, it may be that neurons rely crucially on infinite precision real numbers to function, or it may be, as in the Smythies-Carr hypothesis, that the operation of neurons includes interactions with branes in other dimensions, the physics of which is not computable. In these cases, perhaps brain activity and therefore consciousness cannot be modelled by a computer program. But you have to ask, what reason is there to believe this, and why would evolution not just use straightforward chemistry to build brains, as seems to be the case, but rather go to such trouble to confound us all?\r\n\r\nAs for the question of whether the physical activity in the brain is identical to consciousness, I\'m still not sure why you consider it so important. I\'ll say the physical activity in the brain is not identical to consciousness, but is sufficient to give rise to consciousness. Is that acceptable?\r\n','2009-10-10 10:40:38','2009-10-10 10:40:38'),(437,96,48,'I agree with what John Says:\r\n\r\n    \"The basic question is whether the events in the brain are\r\n    identical, or not, with what goes on in a person\'s consciousness.\r\n    This is a separate question to whether computers can emulate\r\n    what is going on in the neuronal circuits.\" \r\n\r\nAll of this can emulate and model the other.  But to emulate, or behave like something else isn\'t all that is important, and misses some of what something is fundamentally and phenomenally like.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the strawberry has a behavioral property (behavioral or traditional red), such that it reflects 700 nm light.  Though the light can \'model\' this property in much detail, it is not fundamentally, and likely also not phenomenally like the surface of the strawberry.  This abstracting process repeats itself thorough the entire chain of cause and effect perception process.  Again, each downstream representation models the previous, and the initial behavioral property that started everything - but non of them are fundamentally like any of the others.  And, though each subsequent level can model any property, whether phenomenal or not,  the only way to know what the original is fundamentally like, is to ground such representations with the original (effing the ineffable) so you can map the perfectly complete representations back to what they are phenomenally like.  The only representation that we truly know what it is like, is the final one.  The phenomenal red.  Phenomenal red is a property of the final result of the perception process or our knowledge of the behavioral red that started everything.  All of this perfectly models the original - but till you map it back, you don\'t know what the original is really like.\r\n\r\nAbstract representations can model anything, including random behavior.  John, would you agree with the idea that even the multidimensional \'branes\' and everything in the Smythies-Carr hypothesis could be modeled to any level of accuracy desired.  But, again, the model is not phenomenally like the original.\r\n\r\nPhenomenal properties can be modeled.

But there are a few promising theories such as the Smythies-Carr Hypothesis.

These physical / chemical models and descriptions they will discover will explain, behaviorally, how certain kinds of brain stuff has our red sensations and different kinds of stuff have our green sensations, and they will be able to watch and behaviorally understand why these differences enable the system to know where the red strawberry is within the leaves, and see the mechanism that is able to pick the strawberry.  The theory predicts that this physical understanding will include facts like only a special type of matter (maybe only a special chemical reaction) will be able to duplicate the red sensation - in such a way that the subjective experience both has knowledge of red light - and it is behaviorally aware of what that particular chemicals (or whatever) behaviors are.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, we will be able to model such chemical processes with abstracted binary numbers and computational models.

The whole brain would then behave from an external observer\'s point of view as per normal, since the replacement part is functionally equivalent; but if the replacement lacks qualia, the person would be part zombie. The right half of his visual field could be gone, but he would declare that everything is fine, believe that everything is fine, and behave as if everything is fine. It would be like a combination of blindsight and Anton\'s syndrome. This is a truly weird concept, as there is no objective *or* subjective way of knowing that we are not in such a partly zombified state at the moment.\r\n\r\nsee: http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html\r\n\r\nIs \"The Walls of Plato\'s Cave\" available online?\r\n\r\n','2009-10-17 00:58:15','2009-10-17 00:58:15'),(515,96,48,'Stathis,\r\n\r\nIt seems unreasonable to me to expect that qualia \'arise\' from any abstract representation of such.\r\n\r\nWe know that more or less F = M * A.  This fact is simply a fundamental property of matter.  We don\'t say such properties \'arise\' from anything  - they just are.  To ask why F = M * A is, or what it \'arises\' from is simply the wrong thing to do.  We just want to know that it is so, and to use such knowledge to be able to make predictions, and so on.  To demand that we know what qualia arise from is like demanding that we know why F = M * A, or why matter, with any of it\'s fundamental properties, exists at all.\r\n\r\nNature simply is.  It simply has fundamental properties - both behavioral and phenomenal.  Trying to explain the why or how of any of it isn\'t as important as simply knowing the what, and being able to model and predict such.  (as in, when I organize the same correct neural conscious correlate in anyone\'s mind - I can reliably predict that it will always have the same phenomenal red.)\r\n\r\nOur models are, by design, independent of what they are represented or instantiated by.  It doesn\'t matter what the F, the M, the A, or the red or the green are represented by, as long as we can property interpret whatever is representing them - and have the ability to look back to the original they represent - to know what they truly represent, mean, and most importantly, what they are fundamentally like..\r\n\r\nIf you want to get back to its true fundamental nature, what the word red represents and what it is fundamentally like, it is required that you move out of the abstract domain, and map it back to a reproduction of the unique physical whatever it is, that has that phenomenal property.\r\n\r\nEverything about neurons is computable, everything about qualia is computable.  They can all be modeled in myriads of ways, and in general the easiest way is to abstractly model them.\r\n\r\nAnd abstract representations, like the words \'red\' and \'green\' - are just that - representations of such - which aren\'t phenomenally \'like\' anything by design.\r\n\r\nAbstract models, by definition, are not like anything, so to expect that a fundamental phenomenal property can arise from an abstract representation, no matter what happens to be currently representing the representation, is just a completely backwards way to think about it.  We can use phenomenal properties to represent things - abstractly.  There reverse is obviously not true - at least as far as what they are fundamentally and phenomenally like.\r\n\r\nTo expect that the original phenomenal property or fundamental property can be taken from abstract representations, or that fundamental phenomenal properties would arise from any abstract representation, regardless of what matter is representing it, is just the wrong and backwards way to think about it.\r\n\r\nBrent\r\n','2009-10-17 02:21:59','2009-10-17 02:21:59'),(518,96,48,'Brent,\r\n\r\nI understand what you\'re saying.

Sure, they can do intelligent things like drive cars, but they have  no intelligent access to any information about what any knowledge they have is represented with, let alone what it is like.\r\n\r\nAnd, one of the obvious reasons they lack simple common sense, is because of the lack of a solution to the \'binding problem\'.

Either you don\'t believe that anyone can program software that has a phenomenal nature, because the Phenomenality, involves some Psychic aspect that won\'t transfer over to silicon via a program. A valid belief, but only a belief because you haven\'t defined that psychic something except by its effect... ie. Phenomenalism, but somehow it is verbotten to try like it is verbotten to explain F=M*A, which is something that Physicists would be puzzled to find blocking them.\r\n\r\n2. Or, you believe that it is possible with a good enough model, to capture, any function of the brain, even those functions formerly thought to be psychic, either by replacing neurons with silicon, which while possible would require a silicon equivalent to a neuron that we don\'t have yet, or by figuring out how the brain actually works, and building an analog, or emulation/simulation of it. (Emulation if we want to have an exact analog that acts with all the right signals, and Simulation if we are willing just to have a model that \"Works Alike\".\r\n\r\nI realized these two basic camps existed back when I was very young, and realized that the basic test for solving the problem was to let the silicon mages, loose to do their worst. At least that way we would know where the brain and mind models were different, and therefore what psychic part was missing, if only by elimination. Are you really sure that it would be phenomenalism that was missing, or are you just buying the majority view?\r\n\r\nSince then I have realized, that mostly this argument is a paper tiger,\r\ndependent on the idea that we are going to program a computer system to replace the brain. The computer system we use, will probably either include a Virtual Machine that works differently from the standard software, and thus eliminates any demand that software works only one way, and/or has completely different circuits that work using a completely different architectural approach, which is what I personally am working on.\r\n\r\nDon\'t worry it will still be implemented in silicon, although I am currently trending towards a hybrid digital/frequency based circuit and away from strict adherence to Digital architectures.\r\n\r\nHave I defined a direct replacement for the neuron in silicon?\r\n\r\nWell no, I had no need to. All we are really interested in modeling is the data processing regime in the brain, and that is mostly related to signals that pass through the brain. So all I modeled was the signal regime of the neuron. Further because transistors work in a completely different manner than neurons, implementing a transistor based element meant I had to understand what the neurons were doing in groups of different types of neurons, and implement THAT function instead of the neuron function.\r\n\r\nBy doing this interpretation, I have clearly moved away from an Emulation, towards a simulation. The guys that are doing the emulations are tying up hours and hours of large computer time, down in CERN, and have big buck supporters, I am a welfare bum, working alone as yet, and can\'t afford more than about $5.00 at any one point to invest in my work, (Which is partly why people keep claiming I am arm waving)\r\n\r\nSo let us talk about my first circuit. Does it deal with the requirements of Phenomenalism? Well No, But it does group data together into a Data-Cloud when scaled up to arrays. I have long since been informed that I can\'t call the Data-Cloud concept a Quale, because it doesn\'t fit the Phenomenalist mind set of what a Quale is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nHowever the nature of the data cloud is that it tends to cluster elements from all over the brain into \"Functional Clusters\" if only by linking them to a frequency tag so that the data can be filtered. It is this frequency tagging that makes my first circuit a hybrid digital/frequency circuit.\r\n\r\nAm I arm waving, or just really bad at transferring my highly abstract thoughts, into English so that other people can understand them...

Rather than all the handwaving about unknowables like spin momentum and fractals and singularities and noumenal aetheric sources however (sounding very much like Leon Maurer\'s Hoovered-up ABC Theory -- Aggregated Buzzword Concepts) I prefer to keep centered upon what is known and approach the topic scientifically.  That theory\'s scattered vagueness (e.g. \"ubiquitous aether centered entanglement\", \"brain\'s overall neural field\") as buzzword-filled as it sounds still omits exactly how consciousness in the zero point field might interact with a brain to bring into it some of that consciousness.  But it\'s a nice try and correct I think in identifying the source of consciousness as residing in zero point energy.  \r\n\r\n\"What is is the difference from Endogenous light?\"  Photons emitted from mitochondria at any given wavelength ought to be the same as photons emitted from non-endogenous sources, unless there are phenomena going on like pair-produced entanglement that we can only guess at presently.  Endogenous photons will be emitted in synchrony with the brain\'s electrical events in such a way as to contribute to the formation of the nexus though, whereas non-endogenous light that somehow impinged on the cerebral ventricles would only be a noise source.  However it is not difficult to imagine a machine-driven system of photon emission tied to computational mechanisms like endogenous photons are tied to the brain\'s mechanics in such a way as to produce a synthetic nexus and hence a synthetic consciousness.  Note the difference between \'artificial\' and \'synthetic\' in this context would be the same as the difference in diamonds.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know what frequencies of light are output by the mitochondria but if I was designing such a system I would make them multispectral with a number of major peaks and having some ability to shift the frequency, phase, and rotation of any single photon that is output.\r\n\r\n\"how would you consider perception to work?\" The raw neural data coming in from all sensory sources converges at the thalamus causing stimulated photon emissions to be conducted very quickly to the ventricles and nexus so that the consciousness that is looking through the nexus from the zero point side perceives it in almost real time and a short term feedback loop is established to maintain at least some of the data in a waiting state for possible further attention.  The raw data fed to thalamic inputs also continues on to cortex where it is analyzed and representational data about it is returned to the thalamus whereupon it is overlain upon the raw perception in its waiting state to bring meaning into the perception.  Benjamin Libet\'s perplexing experiments become understandable in this model.  Very young children and some unfortunate adults like Terry Schiavo only get the raw data and lack sufficient cortical feedback to supply meaning to the nexus.

Please consider that  founding a camp on such a negative or a negation is, at the outset, premature, deeply flawed and actually unnecessary.   I realize it might be an embarrassment for those who share that particular bias, but as much as it is possible, consider that once you start with that approach, logically, your group does need to go through ALL of the other things  that consciousness has nothing to do with. \r\n\r\nAnd, what is that full list?\r\n\r\n\r\nI have the impression that this unnecessary assumption may be linked to the belief many people hold which roughly says that  knowledge and faith are functional opposites -- as knowledge increases faith is reduced.  However, faith is not the opposite of knowledge. The opposite of knowledge is ignorance.  Similarly, the opposite of faith is not knowledge, but unbelief.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, beginning with the assumption that consciousness has nothing to do with the supernatural starts out with a fairly sophisticated set of notions. First that there is the natural and the supernatural realms. And second that consciousness is clear and wise enough, before definition  to relegate itself as existing separate and disconnected from something that is known to be above or superlative compared with all of nature. \r\n\r\nPerhaps, then, the statement means something different, such as, \"supernatural is hogwash\", or \"supernatural does not exists\", or \"science is supreme\", or \"consciousness is natural\" which would be to say that \"consciousness is emergent\" or something else along some similar convoluted trail. \r\n\r\nIF the camp statement DOES have these other meanings or intends to align with some alternate, unstated position, it seems reasonable the statement might be corrected to express the actual impression. \r\n\r\nI guess this is the flip-side of your plea for \"competitors\" to come into the fold.\r\n\r\nThink about it. \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nRalph Frost','2009-11-27 01:40:15','2009-11-27 01:40:15'),(580,96,48,'You make some interesting points.\r\n\r\nPersonally I would fall into the Consciousness is Natural camp, I think that Physics explanations, and Religious explanations are unneeded, that what is needed is an understanding of the constraints on the architecture of the brain, and once we realize them, not only will consciousness not be supernatural, but it won\'t be all that exotic either.\r\n\r\nI was recently looking at a site that claimed to be doing \"Intention\" experiments such as making a dead leaf glow in the \"Bio-photon\" range, and so on.

For example, we don\'t yet know it is possible to completely cure cancer, so faith is still required.  But as we cure more and more of it, this gives us much more hope, and strengthens our faith that we can make even more progress...

In other words, the observation makes the effect that is being described natural, but the theories are yet to be proven.\r\n\r\nWhat both dark energy and dark matter offer is mathematical models that suggest that the world does not work on the galactic scale the way we observe it to work on the stellar scale. The theories suggest that the differences in the shape of galaxies that we observe to what might be expected to be calculated with the classic model, might be related to either a new force that is not included in our current theories, which is called dark energy (Why a force is called energy, I leave to your imagination) or 75 % of interstellar mass, is not visible using a telescope, why it would not be visible to a telescope is again an exercise for your imagination.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop these theories to the point where a stellar observation can observe them, a lot of theoretical work needs to be done, that will isolate a case where if the theory is correct an observation on the merely stellar scale will confirm the Galactic scale observations. In the meantime, a lot of cranks are going to blame everything in the supernatural on one or the other, in the hopes that supernatural explanations will come back into vogue and we will forget all this pesky science stuff that pokes holes in classic religion and superstition.\r\n\r\nQuite simply Supernatural means not yet observed. Dark energy and Dark matter are not supernatural, they are simply unproven theories of a natural effect, that is not well explained by the current science, but is observable. If you can observe dark energy on a stellar scale, let us know until then, expect to wait for galactic travel to become possible before the science is fully mature.\r\n\r\nConsider if you will that some scientists are doing work on dark energy, and they want to make it fit Einsteins relativity. However the first thing that is required they are told, is to explain what is a positive energy in terms of a negative force. The minute they change the polarity of the force, they destroy its applicability to the dark energy paradigm but they can prove that it can fit Einsteins law. So does the new model constitute science? yes, but one questions whether it constitutes dark energy, or could be used to predict the nature of the observed phenomena.\r\n\r\nScience is made up of lots of these little errors, that get proven by someone else to have missed the mark. Until an observation is made at the stellar level that supports one theory over another, we simply do not know if either dark energy or dark matter could even exist.\r\n\r\nIf I had to vote I would vote for dark energy over dark matter, simply because I favor a model of cosmology based on something very like dark energy that has a positive force component, and achieves relativity because it doesn\'t involve a particle.

I\'m not saying that\'s necessarily evil,  but perhaps the option then becomes laying out physics ~regions, perhaps even speculative physics regions , and then edging the various trial theories into different ones of those regions.  \r\n\r\nThe honest religious and spiritual theorists are going to just be quiet or say  something like \"God is wildly ineffable\".  Then there are all the other instance of structured duality -- or  scribbling up various chunks of structured coding that is going to hit or miss on inducing a broarder paradigmatic shift and consensus. That is,  we\'re all talking about scribbling out structured code and some of that is going to be excessively overly speculative while other chunks are going to be seeds that land in fertile, fruitful soil.    That is,  a likely possibility is bits of one person\'s translation may fit or contribute into some other expressions.

That would be a useful finding, too, falsifying the \"consciousness has a description in ~current physics\".  \r\n\r\nOn the deeper level,   there is also the view that, er, there sort of IS the supernatural level and the natural/physical level  in our natural setup with respect to experience and consciousness of experience.  \r\n\r\nTo try to cover God with another dirty cloth,   I suppose another small,  bland human way to describe this would be to suggest structural codings that are strings of totally rare singularities, influencing adaptations in the structural codings in the more physical levels of organization.  Others might wax poetic in other ways using terms like \"higher-dimensional\", etc.  \r\n\r\nThe trouble with ineffable stuff is we can make up a lot of different descriptions for the one thing.  \r\n\r\nAnyway,  I suspect that some of the recent posts  harmonize with such a tendency.  \r\n\r\nSome readers may notice that I am having moderately good success in this post/thread  and others classifying a very large range of things in terms of structured duality and more specifically  into different sorts of structural codings.   That is particularly true when it comes to translating \"objective\" into being a strongly repeating form of structural coding (or subjectively).   Potentially,  although I expect market forces are still pretty resistant to it,   rather than classify trial theories in the (archaic) terms of physics or different types of science,   the various trial theories could also be spread out in terms of their structured duality or there common sorts of  structural coding.  \r\n\r\nMaybe that will have to develop later. \r\n\r\nI any event,   for the portion of my trial theory that is \"natural or physical\",  put me in the testable scientific, \"current/emerging\" physics if that transitional group exists.   Furthermore, my trial theory is generally in the atomic/molecular or sp3-hybridized ~ size range centering on structural  coding in the ordered water forming within the respiration reaction, linking in large part  via hydrogen bonding with memory, imagination,  touch, smell, sound, sight, expressions and motility, etc.\r\n\r\nNotice that \"all that region\" is pretty implicit and also catalyzed and deeply automatic (and indeed very natural and physical.  The catalyzed aspects, ought to be seen as sufficient initial explanation for existence of any \"gap\"  that one may worry about. Also,  of course, the functioning flow is the internal analog language is primary; the neurologic and of course the word-sound-gesture expressions are secondary.  \r\n\r\nThe deeper \"physics\" structured duality, once it emerges,  generally has a more unified multiple state quantum gravitation flavor. \r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps others can classify their trial theories in a similar manner, relating ~size range/coding. \r\n\r\nThink about it. \r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\nRalph\r\n\r\nhttp://structuredduality.blogspot.com\r\nhttp://magtet.com/images/phpshow.php','2009-12-07 18:32:32','2009-12-07 18:32:32'),(668,96,48,'Consciousness Theoreticians,\r\n\r\nrefrost said: \"The honest religious and spiritual theorists are going to just be quiet or say something like \"God is wildly ineffable.\" and I think such would be unfortunate.

The proposed text, particularly about science facilitating a human-specified \"improved re-engineering\", to me is pretty fanciful and unrealistic, though.  I mean,  from one of the mainline schools of thought, science, teaching, education, the growth of knowledge is a spiritual gift --  a gift from God.  And if one looks into the growing tonnage quantities of anti-depressants consumed each day as we move further into the current version of science and  \"faith in science\",  rational people might take that fact as a signal that something is slightly amiss and further re-engineered \"improvements by science alone\",  is not necessarily a great wager. \r\n\r\nAlong the same tact,  pick up just about any text dealing with, say, the adult children of alcholics syndrome, or, say, any of the other items in the DSM-IV-TR  (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition, Text Revision ) and notice that our mental and emotional challenges are quite entrenched, pervasive, and complicated having historical roots documented, say, all the way back through the Bible.  Remedies are interactive and typically only proceed with faith-based spiritual approaches in on believing in the face of all  present evidence that beneficial change CAN somehow occur.  That is, there is a lot of work to do, and  when finding oneself in the trenches, something new and hope-filled is ALWAYS needed.  Hope is another gift from God. Sometimes it also manifests as new science. \r\n\r\nSeeking to fashion together a new and helpful model of consciousness, however,  while what you suggest is one approach, Brent,   and might be acceptable for another transition, however, I propose and ask the group to consider classifying models and theories in terms of structural coding and general size ranges.  That is,   all of the various models and trial theories ARE going to be some type of structurally coded imagery and, certainly the scientific instances are going to be fashioned together in some type of media and size range. Even the more philosophical or abstract mathematical trial theories involve some type of structural coding focusing on widgets at some size range.  \r\n\r\nThat would get, say,  subatomic, atomic-molecular, cellular... size ranges and then various sorts of media as in electromagnetic, atomic-molecular,  macro-molecular, etc., types of structural coding.  \r\n\r\nThis would put the respiration driven ordered water trial theory I advocate in the atomic-molecular size range where inbound and outbound transactions are all structured coded in the 10^20 molecule per second flow of ordered water.  Then those layers structurally code with adjacent atomic-molecular structural coding.And, one gets memory, imagination, and the levels of un-sub-conscious, basically, all in nested layers of  the same or similar structural coding. And where this internal analog math works ahead of and primary to the traditionally idealized neural networking.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of getting into a structural coding classification is then when one wants or needs to link to, say,  protein folding or motility or expression, he or she ought to be able to make some attempt to describe how such things \"work\" in their model.  Proposing a way might then allow for some calculations to be done on energy requirements.  Similarly,  one\'s structural coding ought to readily support various forms of mental and emotional problems.\r\n\r\nThis is all fairly straightforward when forming active hydrogen bonding packets in the on-going 10^20 molecule per second bit flux rate forming an internal reflection of our experience in the \"ordered water  layer\".  Presumably, it ought to be just as straightforward for other successful or competing  trial theories. .\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for your suggestion that my trial theory fit in with \"requires new science\",   on one hand, that seems right since I am talking about the need to go through a transition to shift the scientific paradigm and activate a new and improved global science education effort. However, if you notice, I am hawking Comenius\'s notion from the middle 1600\'s where there is one basic principle, and basically I am saying that the central education change is teaching and emphasizing tetrahedral structure before and  after adding the cube as an enfolding structure.

I would guess that non-REM sleep is a time of nearly purely autonomic functioning with no ELN being formed in the ventricles, but I would not be surprised if I turned out to be wrong about that.  Dreaming in REM sleep however clearly involves a kind of self-aware experience that we would probably call consciousness if we were having the same experiences while awake, so the logical inference in terms of ELN theory would be that a nexus of some kind is formed during dreaming and the main question to be asked would be \'how is a dream nexus different from an awake one?\'.\r\n\r\nFirst we know that sensory inputs during dreaming are not the same as during the awake state, though there can be overlap between them.  Somehow there exist internal sources of dream inputs for the visual, auditory, proprioceptive, and other sensory stimuli perceived during dreaming.  We also know that these internal sources of sensory stimuli are turned off upon awakening and switched over to external sources (for the most part, perhaps this is a problem for schizophrenics).  Please see http://sleepsurfing.com to learn how to observe this switchover from internal to external sensory inputs upon awakening.  The most parsimonious assumption would be that the same spatial regions used in the cerebral ventricles to process vision for example during the awake state using external inputs would also be the same regions used to process vision during dreaming with internal inputs, but that does not absolutely have to be the case.  An alternative explanation might be that the dreaming nexus forms primarily in the fourth ventricle instead of the third ventricle as in the awake state.  In either case the nexus itself probably varies significantly between waking and dreaming states, certainly in terms of the structures of the interference patterns formed and possibly in terms of nexus photon density, dominant wavelengths, polarization, and subsets of the zero point energy interacted with.  Perhaps the ventricular cilia beat in the opposite direction during dreaming than they do in the waking state, many other physiologic differences might exist too.

If Brent and others really feel they must co-mingle and color scientific exploration with personal hopes, perhaps that can be done in a sub-camp, or else added as a \"Statement of desire\" which includes the words, \" MAY LEAD TO...\" improvements...  \r\n\r\nI mean, let\'s say we scribble out the working theory and then notice that, say, two or three levels of organization outward there is a level of influence and \"control\"  which is NOT under our puny influence and control, which, say, prompts for, say,  re-adoption of what I think many would consider completely irrational and unscientific expressions and activities, and even then, will there might be some improvements due to the improved clarity,  the total control remains forever elusive.  \r\n\r\nIf one clutters up their top camp statement with this unfounded emotionalism when one already can see and agree with the distinction, what\'s that if not unconscious or subconscious clutter?\r\n\r\nRegarding the heartfelt motive or tendency, which we all share that runs along that very line, though, expressed by Brent as the hope to \"increase one\'s free will\", or get more of what one wants or that is possible,...,  oddly enough, there is PLENTY of Christian Science around that points to the virtues of becoming free and renewing one\'s mind through a particular paradigmatic belief and sets of exercises and activities --  that ALREADY provide the desired character upgrades and/or improvements. \r\n\r\nI mean, practically speaking,  were you serious about re-engineering your broken-will issues or elevating your level of satisfaction, you or anyone else can immediately go out and get in some recovery program or engage in developing different relationships or be of more service to others in your community.  You can do that starting now.  Re-newing one\'s mind. Start today.  No need to wait, unless one is simply insecure and overly dependent on authorities or approval. And, even if that, getting into recovery programs can help work through that.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, if you follow,  why not clean up the top level statement and leave it \"Approachable by science\", leaving off the political agenda or else making those desires explicit in a sub-top doctrines?\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce I get through with traveling that ground, however,  and I consider Lenny\'s intellectualized religious expressions, or his religiousized intellectual expressions,  I still  recommend focusing in on structural coding rather than \"science\" since all we are haggling over is sifting and sorting  -- structurally coding a description that really fits.   Thus,  the new or existing, or the reductive/non-reductive  \"science\" are all just different sorts of structural coded models.  And the one that will work and persist WILL definitely have specific of recognizable/repeatable scale/size ranges and levels structural organization.  Otherwise, those monkeys won\'t ever be \"rational\" even in the revised paradigms.  \r\n\r\nSo there are the trial theories --  the structural codings  that work and those that don\'t.\r\n\r\nIf someone absolutely cannot point at a size/scale range or a level of structural organization related to their  trial theory,  they are simply talking about philosophy or opinion. \r\n\r\nPerhaps another way to consider this terrain is to think about doing a \"special theory\"  prior to doing the \"general theory\". The special theory is human consciousness.  Or, perhaps even figuring out bee or ant \"consciousness\" for individual(s) and the interactive group(s).  \r\n\r\nBut even when we go into that terrain we are rapidly talking about looking for common, replicating  structural codings that are deeply linked into optimizing or relating into an energetic objective function.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThus, again: classify things on a size and structural level.\r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\nRalph \r\n','2010-01-11 10:05:41','2010-01-11 10:05:41'),(711,96,48,'\"Approachable Via  Science\" â€” without any limiting statement â€” seems okay for all sub camps that have scientific theories of consciousness (and mind) based on ANY scientific paradigm...  \r\n\r\nSo, why should it be limited to \"classifying things on a size and structural level\" in preference to classifying them on a radiant energy or informational level -- no matter how such information is encoded?\r\n\r\nThis clearly then opens the door to all advanced physics and cosmological theories, including quantum fields, quantum gravity, quantum mechanics, strings, membranes, many world, holographic paradigm, etc. â€” without restricting any material-oriented theories based on consciousness as an epiphenomena of structural informational coding, neural processing, electromagnetic fields, sub quantum ZPE fields, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nLHM','2010-01-12 06:22:37','2010-01-12 06:22:37'),(714,96,48,'Hey, Lenny, \r\n\r\nIs your last post you stating you are agreeing?

But that includes all aspects of science (as I explained before) â€” not just reductive science limited to material structural organization or structural coding â€” which assumes, unjustifiably, that matter is fundamental or all there is.  This claim only considers the physical/material plane of reality, and cannot explain higher hyperspace realms, or altered states of consciousness, qualia, dreams, intuition, psi phenomenal or other paranormal effects like OOBE, NDE, etc.â€” without resorting to those materialistic presumptions coupled with pure guesswork.. Since there is no way that subjectivity can be conflated with objectivity.\r\n\r\nThere are many other theories that assume consciousness is fundamental and considers that science can \"approach\" (not solve the hard problems of) consciousness, only by explaining the actual physical mechanisms of the correlates of consciousness, such as neural processes, and the transformation and transmission of encoded information between the senses and consciousness, through the brain\'s EM field coupled resonantly with the higher (frequency-energy) order mind memory fields â€” such as my ABC model, and McFadden\'s CEMI field theory... Although this latter theory still assumes that consciousness (awareness, will, etc.) is an epiphenomena of neural processes due to EM feedback effects â€” which I don\'t buy.\r\n\r\nThis EM field nature of the information of consciousness, is far more likely in my view â€” since general relativity proves that all space-time electromagnetic fields are far more fundamental than any later evolved material structures -- since its obvious that quarks and quantum particles, as well as atoms, composed of such particle-fields, came long before ordered water or any other material forms of mass-energy â€” which is, essentially, \"space in linear motion\" (as Einstein pointed out)... And, since then, Milo Wolff proved that all such fundamental particles, in fact, all material structures, are actually composed of spherical standing waves (of Einstein\'s Aether).  And, obviously, the ZPE fields (along with their sub quantum particles) in the Planck false vacuum, are even more fundamental than the quantum fields.  \r\n\r\nStephen Hawkins considers that information is never lost, even in a black hole.  And where else can such information be stored, but in the transformed higher order \"light\" EM field at the surface of the event barrier?  And, aren\'t we all made out of pure light?  And, isn\'t a polarized photon standing wav, as the first structured duality, also capable of carrying modulated information?  What other blueprint would a supposed God creator or cosmic consciousness use to plan its structures?\r\n\r\nWhere else (other than such EM fields) could the holographic blueprint information of the structure of all such particles and their forms, as well as the protein structural information in the DNA, be stored?  Or, does your God play dice? ;-)\r\n\r\nSo, what difference is there in the structural information of the human body and the holographic information of consciousness detected, converted, experienced and interpreted by our zero-points of awareness at the centers of all our ubiquitous, internally generated EM mind-memory fields?  \r\n\r\nThe only classification of size in any field theories related to the nature of consciousness, mind and matter (as separate but interdependent fundamental entities) â€” is the size of each harmonic field of consciousness -- with the smallest higher frequency-energy phase order fields limited to the sub-quantum Planck distance, located everywhere in metric space-time, at the origin of all standing wave particles, atoms, molecules, and their composite forms. \r\n\r\nSo, in my view, any reductive theory of consciousness â€” as an epiphenomena of material structure (ordered or otherwise) or based on any physical processes of any kind â€” is simply barking up a tree...  Since, subjectivity (awareness, will, etc.) as  creator, cannot be created by objective material forms â€” no matter how they are evolved or physically created.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nLenny\r\n','2010-01-14 07:49:24','2010-01-14 07:49:24'),(720,96,48,'It sounds like some people like the following new proposal for the not supernatural camp:\r\n\r\nNew Name: \'\'\'Approachable Via Science\'\'\'\r\n\r\nStatement addition:\r\n \"We believe consciousness to be approachable via the\r\n scientific method.

Of course the idea that we will be hacking and improving consciousness is still just theory, that will remain falsified for the foreseeable future.  Believing that we might be able to do a lot more someday, is not meant to be an edict about what is absolutely true.  All it is meant to be is a declared working hypothesis or belief, a goal if you will.

If on the contrary you were to believe that science already knows and understands everything worth knowing and there is nothing left to discover, then you might be pretty flustered by consciousness conflicting with that worldview.  It seems a safe assumption that most people interested in consciousness do hold the first view that there is much science does not know yet, otherwise they could already explain consciousness and their explanations could be demonstrated scientifically.  On the basis of the assumption that the universe must hold many unknowns left for science to discover it is possible to continue associating the \'vast pool of energy\' with \'consciousness\':\r\n\r\n1. SOMETHING has to explain consciousness, unless one takes the view that consciousness does not exist or that it is unexplainable but since those would simply be opinions argued from ignorance and against the evidence they can be dismissed as unscientific.  So we start looking at the physical phenomena we know and the historical record of human knowledge gained so far to try to make sense of it.\r\n\r\n2. The universe IS filled with a vast web of crisscrossing light, obvious on any starry night.\r\n\r\n3. Experiments with the Cassini Effect do show that there is \'zero-point\' (or whatever it may be called) energy popping in and out of our existence constantly but without staying long.  This would suggest an existence outside our own where the zero point energy resides when it isn\'t briefly in ours, unless you believe in energy arising from nothing.  Physicists I\'ve read seem to be in agreement that the zero point energy not only exists but in its own frame of reference its energy is immense, energies in empty space far exceeding the nuclear energies available in equal volumes of any kind of matter.  \r\n\r\n4. Einstein showed that as the speed of an object increases times slows down for it, and this has been proven by experiment.  At the speed of light however time falls to zero, so light experiences zero time regardless of how many billions of light years of empty space it may appear to us to cross.  In light\'s frame of reference no time passes and there is no such thing as distance, the universe is a point source as far as the light is concerned.  Matter however can never reach the speed of light because its mass also increases with speed and at the speed of light its mass would become infinite, and that is a physical impossibility or the universe would have been destroyed by now.  Matter is therefore always time-bound, including us as creatures made of matter.  Light is all happening at once in its frame of reference, and that applies to every photon in the universe.  It may be difficult for us to comprehend but it\'s true.\r\n\r\n5. Every major religion of the world holds holy some reference to God as Light and every prophet and yogi and other enlightened soul in history from Jesus to Yogananda has in one way or another spoken of God as Light, the Light within us, et cetera.  You can discount religion all you want and while they mostly deserve it when they do all have something in common it is worth considering; not any particular religion\'s special superstitions but that which they all have in common, God or Allah or Cosmic Consciousness or Divinity or Father Son Spirit or Greater Intelligence or whatever it\'s called it doesn\'t matter, what does matter is that they all reference some higher consciousness than our own that is associated with light.  While there is no objective scientific proof of any such higher consciousness yet, there is sometimes subjective proof presented to people that later tell about it, and from this we do have evidence that there might be such a thing.  It cannot be disproven and atheistic arguments are just as faith-driven as the most evangelical ones, the only completely rational hardcore position to hold in the absence of any personal experience with higher consciousness is simple agnosticism: you just don\'t know one way or the other.  That\'s okay you don\'t know what the very center of the earth really looks like either.  So the common element that is in all religions should be considered with at least the level of respect that is generally given scientific speculation about other unknowables like the origin of the universe (e.g. Big Bang) and the interiors of black holes for example, as those are completely unprovable areas of potential knowledge as compared to many first-person accounts of encounters with higher consciousness. \r\n\r\n6. Light interference patterns can form holograms and holograms can hold information and programs even with just our present knowledge and technologies, consequently that \'vast pool of energy\' commonly called zero-point energy must be undergoing interference of its own and forming an interference pattern or patterns of some kind filling the entire universe at very high energy densities.  And somehow doing so all at once in its own frame of reference.  The safest assumption would be that our present understanding of light interference and holography falls far short of fully explaining all of the potential interactions there must be in the zero-point energy, wide as the universe and spanning not only all of space but all of time as well.  We may be like ants trying to understand the workings of a nuclear reactor, a little humility is required.  It is not unreasonable to consider that the higher consciousness which every religion and enlightened being has referred to as Light exists in the \'vast pool of energy\' which has been identified by science and called zero-point energy.  \r\n\r\nSo that\'s the Logical Leap from the \'vast pool of energy\' to a higher consciousness, then follows individual consciousness:\r\n\r\n1. There are endogenous photons emitted from all cells tested so far.\r\n\r\n2. There exist mechanisms for those endogenous photons to be conducted between cells and to form dynamically resonant interference patterns in the brain\'s ventricular spaces and possibly in some surrounding tissues.  Those patterns would be dynamically resonant with the brain\'s electrical events, being shaped by the electrical events and in turn able to influence them.  \r\n\r\n3. Interference patterns formed by endogenous light in the brain would be time-bound to the brain\'s electrical events but being light, like all other light in the universe it would also exist outside of our time-bound frame of reference in its own timeless frame of reference and able to interact with the interfering light in the zero-point energy.  Our own endogenous light then in this model is a \"nexus\" or connection point for a bit of the higher consciousness in the zero-point energy to inhabit our brains and bodies.

And, in accord with my ABC model of cosmogenesis (including the analogous genesis of all harmonic fields generated from each zero-point singularity at the center of every sentient cell, organ and organism) â€” it\'s apparent that the \"television screen\" or \"brane\" John speaks of, is actually the highest frequency/energy (f/E) order em fields in sub quantum hyperspace, that are resonant with the lowest order EM field of the Brainâ€¦ Which fields contain the initial brain assembled and transformed information of consciousness, in the form of analogous holographic wave interference patterns on their surfaces.  \r\n\r\n(Incidentally, these modulated information fields, linked with the brain field at analogous light frequencies, may be the source of the detected ELF \"biophotons\" spoken of by Philip Benjamin... And, the lower f/E orders of hyperspace fields may be the \"dark\" matter postulated by him as our invisible \"shadow body\"â€” as also observed indirectly by cosmologists, and directly by Russian scientists as so called \"phantom, DNA\" and the aura fields of Kirlian photography.)\r\n\r\nThe mechanism needed to detect and reconstruct these signals so as to converge at a conscious zero-point in the center of the brain, is explained simply by the subconsciously wiled radiant projection and reflection of coherent higher f/E order light energy (at the highest harmonic EM field frequency) directly from the ZPE spin momentum at the source of the final information carrying field closest to the zero-point of visual, awareness, and at least one phase order of f/E higher than the brainâ€™s EM field.  Obviously, the longest term memory fields would be closest to the zero-point at the highest f/E.\r\n\r\nCellular consciousness such as taste, smell, touch, would work in a similar localized manner... While all zero point fields of consciousness would be entangled (at the sub quantum level) with our individual global consciousness â€” probably located at the exact center of our overall highest order harmonic body field centered in the naval plexus.  The body\'s lowest order harmonic electrical fields, analogously, would naturally be centered in the heart plexus â€” as shown in the diagram at: http://leonmaurer.info/ABCimages/Chakrafielddiag-fig.col.jpg\r\n\r\nThis holographic convergence centered in non local points of access consciousness (pure awareness) is analogous to the way all light photon ray signals, reflected from or radiated by all cosmic objects, converge at every zero-point between any observer POV and the objects of observation (e.g., stars, etc.).  So, what we experience as visual qualia, is the actual holographic image itself, recreated in the mind field â€” which is seen from a single POV (wherever in the spherical outer world that the visual center of the brain is located) in whatever angular direction we point our eyes.\r\n\r\nObviously, this system, not only resolves all the hard problems, but satisfies Occam\'s razor, by being far more parsimonious than any possible epiphenomena theory of consciousness based on complex and unjustifiable electrochemical neural processes, structural-material encoding, torsional or quantum effects, \"wave collapse\" in microtubules, resonance, etc., etc.  \r\n\r\nIt\'s also as simple in concept as the modern electronic communication of 3-dimensional television and motion pictures... Which are based on intuitive reverse engineering of natural internal image processing and transmission processes â€” that are the most efficient solutions to the storage, transmission and reception of visual information.   Obviously, the longest lasting image storage media in the physical universe are the higher orders of frequency/energy ZPE fields in the Planck false vacuum...  And also â€” only a perfectly stationary point of awareness can detect and differentiate between the finest frequency modulations of the highest f/E order EM fields in micro space.  Such a fixed subjective reference point can only be located in the static center of spin momentum of the ZPE singularity at the origin of all radiant EM fields in total space. Therefore, every material form is potentially phenomenally conscious to a degree depending on the complexity of its sensory mechanisms.\r\n\r\nLM\r\n','2010-01-24 20:15:36','2010-01-24 20:15:36'),(764,96,48,'\r\nHi Lenny,\r\n\r\nI see you have removed all the old text from the statement.

I don\'t however see this as a valid argument, since it presupposes that we understand how the dynamics of neural processes work, and there are still some mysteries, that haven\'t been dealt with, and answers from which might suddenly make the signaling at the neural level understandable, or at least understandably chaotic.\r\n\r\nI see the problem with the neural signalling translation, as being more a case of lack of tolerance for uncertainty, than a lack of understanding of signalling characteristics.\r\n\r\nBut if what you want is science fiction with mathematical models, I guess you might be attracted to this model.','2010-01-25 05:53:38','2010-01-25 05:53:38'),(779,96,48,'\r\nBrent,\r\nyou say:\r\n\r\n    \"I guess, then, the only way Liebnitz\'s law would apply,\r\n    is if you assumed that all the properties of the representation\r\n    were identical to all the properties of the original?

It is obvious that phenomenal events and brain events (which are supposed to be identical under IT) have hardly any properties in common.

The phenomenal visual field is the end station (where the results of neurocomputations are presented but not further processed).

Also unified to this awareness is the informational stuff about the leaves and the strawberries that are not lost with blindsight.\r\n\r\nI guess the identity theory predicts that there will be real stuff in our brain that is what our thoughts are made of.

Within your theory, neural correlate is a good term.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at this stuff, through cause and effect observation, all you will â€˜seeâ€™ is abstract representations of the causal effects of the stuff.

So, what we actually see in the mindâ€™s eye is a reconstructed analogous higher order holographic light image of various relative frequencies, representing color, tone, shade, etc.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s the difference between all those empty points of primal space, and the zero-point of awareness in the center of our head, from which we perceive the surrounding universe as a holographic image (after the brain transforms the 2-d image on the retina to a hologram on the surface of the brainâ€™s assembled EM field â€” which is resonant with the higher order mind-memory fields in hyperspace)?  \r\n\r\nWouldnâ€™t that necessitate that each such zero-point point of awareness is of a different quality (subjectivity) than the surrounding matter fields (objectivity) â€” including the total space-timeâ€™s electro-gravitational fields themselves (including the hyperspace fields in the Planck false vacuum) â€” which are simply a more tenuous form of primal matter generated from the fundamental spin momentum of the ZP â€œsingularityâ€ located everywhere?\r\n\r\nIt follows, then, that all the visual light information converging on each potential POV must be a hologram (with respect to our individual viewpoint) that is carried on the surfaces of the surrounding radiant mind and memory fields, as frequency modulated wave interference patterns. \r\n\r\nSuch patterns can be easily reconstructed into a holographic image by radiation of a coherent ZPE field and its reflection back to the conscious zero-point source of the higher order mind-memory fields (linked resonantly to the brainâ€™s EM field).  This is described in more detail at my camp statement.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this is a completely scientific view of consciousness and its origin, functions and mechanisms â€” although it doesnâ€™t entirely conform with the current matter only paradigm of conventional reductive science. \r\n\r\nSince the light images we actually perceive in wakeful vision, dreams, or in memory would have to be at a level of energy one or more orders weaker than the photon energy that impinges directly on the retinas â€” these mind and memory fields would have to be harmonically resonant with the EM field of the brain carrying the hologram of the neural processed retinal images on its surface.   \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in order for consciousness to be sensitive enough to be aware of the finest vibrations of the endogenously processed light images that we experience in such dream states or when in deep contemplation of higher states of consciousness â€” it must be absolutely stationary. \r\n\r\nTherefore, it could only be an aspect of the eternal unconditioned (inert, static) absolute zero space that is separate from and outside of all vibrating energy fields that carry the holographic information of consciousness as modulated wave interference patterns on their surfaces (even though these fields originate from the spin momentum surroundong that stationary zero-point).\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this ZP center of our visual consciousness could bery well correspond to the \"third eye\' spoken of in most Eastern philosophies. \r\n\r\nLHM\r\n','2010-02-03 07:09:19','2010-02-03 07:09:19'),(790,1,98,'Whitehead\'s Process God in a nutshell: \r\nfrom\r\n GodBeyondOrthodoxy-r3.pdf\r\n\r\nâ€¢ The ultimate units of reality are momentary units of becoming called â€œactual occasions.\"\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Each actual occasion has a Passive and an active side. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ In its passive mode it apprehends or â€œprehendsâ€ the actual occasions that came before it.

But the way it is currently cast, will encourage everyone with a different POV not to join?\r\n\r\nOne possible solution could be to, instead of \"Is transhumanism a Disorder\" it could instead be something more like: \"What is Transhumanism?\"  And the same for the agreement statement - much of that could be moved into a POV camp.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, you could have a \'transhumanism is a disorder\' POV camp to stand with other camps that have a different POV.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, there is probably definitely benefit in asking - specifically - this question about if transhumanism  is a disorder or not.\r\n\r\nI\'m interested in knowing if you think this is a polite policy?\r\n\r\nUpward,\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2010-02-05 03:05:13','2010-02-05 03:05:13'),(792,1,11,'There are psychic and healing abilities that can be conducted by individuals who are familiar with the terrain of science in which they are being conducted.  \r\n\r\nI\'ve found Matrix Energetics to be an interesting blend of science and healing.  \r\n\r\nMost of the spiritual stuff out there in the \'new age\' movement is leaching onto quantum physics in order to validate miracle-making modalities.

As many of you know, canonizer.com does not yet have a good system that shows the difference of proposed edits like wikipedia.  So I\'m hoping this description here will help everyone easily see the differences I will be submitting with this version.\r\n\r\nI\'m going to replace the title and first three paragraphs with:\r\n\r\n===================================================\r\n\r\n= Representational Qualia Theory =\r\n\r\nhttp://canonizer.com/files/epist2.gif\r\n\r\nWe believe that our conscious knowledge is represented with qualia.  In computers, abstract ones and zeros represent knowledge.  By design, what these ones and zeroes are represented with does not matter, as long as you properly interpret the representations.  Qualia, (i.e. red vs green) like ones vs zeros, can also represent information, but unlike ones and zeros, what is doing the representation, what they are phenomenally like, and the fact that the system is aware of such, is all important.\r\n\r\nThe causal properties of the surface of the strawberry initiate the perception process, but the first causally downstream representation (i.e. 700nm light), though it can be interpreted to represent the causal properties of the strawberry, are not fundamentally or phenomenally anything like the original.  This is why qualia are ineffable, and why we are blind to anything of the surface of the strawberry, other than it\'s causal properties.\r\n\r\nThe final result of this perception process is our conscious knowledge.  This knowledge is represented by qualia which are unified into the conscious world that is our awareness.  This unification process allows us to know all at the same time what the red is like, and how it is different from the green which we represent the leaves with.\r\n\r\n==========================================================\r\n\r\nI\'ll make a few other minor changes in other places to be consistent with this.\r\n\r\nAlso, notice that I completely removed the paragraph on approachable via the scientific method, since this doctrine has now been successfully moved up to the higher level camp.\r\n\r\nI\'m also going to add the following 3 paragraph near the end, to help distinguish this form of representational qualia from others that also claim to be representationalists.\r\n\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\nA few people claim to be representationalists, while promoting the use of terribly confusing and ambiguous terms such as our representations are \'transparent\' in a way that allows us to be aware of what we are looking at.  Or they say things like \"every qualia is a representation\".  As soon as you say something ambiguous like our representations are \'transparent\' this allows people to quickly jump to the should be obviously erroneous conclusion that phenomenal red is really on the surface of the strawberry, and that our representations, because of their \'transparency\' allow us to see through them to be aware of such.  You can see terribly confused people struggling with these ideas all over the place because of terribly unclear terminology such as this.  See the liberal use of the word transparent in the works of [https://webspace.utexas.edu/tyem/www/ Michel Tye], [http://www.philosophie.uni-mainz.de/metzinger/ Thomas Metziner] and others.\r\n\r\nWhen you say something like \'every quale is a representation\', again this confuses the issues and does not accurately mechanically portray what is the representation, and what is being represented.  Such an idea is what allows philosophers to make terrible mistakes such as thinking: \"We don\'t really have a red phenomenal property, it only seems like we do.\"  We believe it is much more mechanically accurate to simply say qualia represent.\r\n\r\nA few so called representationalists also name something they call the phenomenal principle - \"That If there sensibly appears to a subject to be something which possesses a particular sensible quality then there is something of which the subject is aware which does possess that sensible quality.\" And they deny such a principle.  We believe such a principle, but think it is much better to simply say our brains use qualia to represent things, and that what these qualia are like, how they are different, and how we are aware of such in a unified way, is critically important to the process.\r\n\r\n=========================================================\r\n\r\nThat\'s about it.\r\n\r\nOf course, if anyone sees a mistake I\'m making, or they don\'t agree with any of these proposed changes, I hope you\'ll object to this submittal, and help us all resolve any such issues so we can represent what everyone agrees on in the best most concise possible way.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n','2010-02-22 05:36:18','2010-02-22 05:36:18'),(802,96,48,'Theoreticians. \r\n\r\nThis is just an FYI note to let everyone know that two well supported camps in this topic are proposing name changes. \r\n\r\n[http://canonizer.com/thread.asp/88/6/8/2#2 The \"Consciousness is Representational and Real\" camp is changing their name to  \"Representational Qualia Theory\"].\r\n\r\n[http://canonizer.com/thread.asp/88/7/2 And the \"Nature Has Ineffable Phenomenal Properties\" camp is changing it\'s name to \"Property Dualism\"].\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in more info, and or helping review these changes, see the above links to notes describing these changes in their respective camp forums. \r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\nBrent Allsop ','2010-02-22 05:53:32','2010-02-22 05:53:32'),(803,35,62,'\r\nHi Rich,\r\n\r\nThanks for the improvements to this camp and the statement.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know how \'resurrection\' and stuff got in there, nice to get them fixed.\r\n\r\nThere are just a few things that I think are moving a bit in the wrong direction.

We believe that such has a good probability of leading to the greatest scientific discovery of all time - what and how consciousness is.  We believe more scientific funding should be applied to this field of study than any other field of science.\r\n\r\nWe also believe qualia should be a critically important part of this scientific research.  It is important that nuts and bolts neural researchers be much more educated about leading theories that make powerful prediction of what, where, and how qualia might be.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost of importance is that neural researchers, even if they don\'t have a qualophile camp as their current favorite or \'working hypothesis\' they should at least be aware of how much expert consensus there is on how important qualia are to the study of consciousness, and consider ways to test for, falsify, or whatever such leading theories.\r\n\r\nSecond, we need to know where to look for qualia.  In other words, a red qualia is not a property of whatever is the initial cause of the perception process.  A red qualia is a property of our knowledge of such - the final result of the perception process.  It is also important to distinguish between what a red qualia is like, and the information it represents.\r\n\r\nThirdly, it is important to know what the leading theories predict are ways to look for qualia.  Obviously, ineffable phenomenal properties cannot be observed through traditional cause and effect based observation.  Whatever it is that is our knowledge, or that is a neural correlate of a red phenomenal property, we certainly should not expect it to reflect 700nm (red) light.  We need to find neural correlates that reliably predict when someone is experiencing something like red.  Ultimately, As V.S. Ramachandran first described in their seminal 3 laws of qualia paper, we need to do something like use a bundle of neurons, working like the Corpus callosum must work, so connected brains can have an experience after which the subject might say something like: \"oh THAT is what salt tastes like for you.\"\r\n','2010-03-13 23:53:13','2010-03-13 23:53:13'),(814,96,48,'\r\nFolks,\r\n\r\nAs you know we recently changed the name of the leading consensus camp to \"Representational Qualia Theory\".\r\n\r\nAlready, if you search for this on google, we are the second entry listed!\r\n\r\nI think this kind of search engine optimization is critical to becoming a more comprehensive survey.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this topic\'s title is: \"Theories of Mind and Consciousness\", but the shorter name is just \"Mind and Consciousness\" which is a big problem as far as search engine optimization goes.\r\n\r\nI think it is critical that we change the short name from \"Mind and Consciousness\" to \"Theories of Consciousness\".

Thank you so much for bringing your new theory into canonizer.com as a supporting sub camp of this â€œApproachable Via Scienceâ€ camp.  You really picked things up fast, and this new [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/37 Consciousness From Detection, Reaction, and Association] camp is a great contribution already.\r\n\r\nI havenâ€™t had time yet to fully read and digest your work, but I wanted to get this quick forum post off now to welcome you to the â€œApproachable Via Scienceâ€ team.\r\n\r\nYou indicated you believed there might be a better structure for things than we currently have.  The structure has undergone many significant changes in the past as new people have come on board, and surely there will be much more of this kind of stuff as more people come on board.  The best way to resolve such issues is to start by you simply describing to everyone here what structure you think would be best.  Then we can work at moving in that direction as much as possible with the ultimate goal of concisely and quantitatively representing what everyone believes and uses in their thinking on this issue.\r\n\r\nFrom what Iâ€™ve seen of your work so far, it looks like a purely functional theory, and I havenâ€™t yet seen anything addressing qualia or the â€˜hard problemâ€™ â€“ other than to say: the detection, reaction and association tasks you describe are adequate to achieve consciousness.  So it is great to have such a purely functional camp now so well represented here by you and your work.  Iâ€™m sure there are a lot more people that think similar to you, and expect more people to join your camp going forward.\r\n\r\nMy recollection, in a brief moment we had to discuss the issue, was that you thought the computational functionalism camp belongs above the â€œRepresentational Qualia Theoryâ€ camp in a super camp kind of way.

And also, anyone in the current computational functionalism camp, feel free pitch in, or make sure I (in a very different camp) get things right.\r\n\r\nI believe the Current â€œComputational Functionalismâ€ camp, as indicative of its parent camps, differs from your work in that it much more recognizes the primacy of qualia, it being more than just functional behavior, the location of such qualia (a property of our knowledge of the strawberry, not the strawberry) and the fact that these qualia, as Chalmerâ€™s argues, arise from any functionally equivalent organization.\r\n\r\nFrom what I know of your work, it seems to differ from that, in more of an eliminativist view like Dennett would espouse.  My understanding is that you argue that Detection, Reaction, and association (all functional stuff) is sufficient, and that there is no real hard problem.\r\n\r\nWhile Chalmers argues that there is something extra that, in some yet to be figured out â€˜hardâ€™ way, attaches to anything (from silicone, to water pipes, to people in a Chinese roomâ€¦) that is functionally equivalent.\r\n\r\nSo, if Iâ€™m not missing anything, I think the current structure of camps is the best, and clearly shows the difference between your functionalist camp, and the one Chalmers argues for, which thinks there is more to qualia than just functional behavior.\r\n\r\nAlso, if there are any of the doctrines in any of these currently competing to your camp that you agree with (such as the location of qualia, that it will be ineffable, or whatever) be sure to let us know so we can create a super camp containing all that we agree on.\r\n\r\nAgain, welcome, and thanks for your contribution!\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n','2010-04-19 22:03:17','2010-04-19 22:03:17'),(838,96,48,'Consciousness Theoreticians,\r\n\r\nAs you know, we recently changed the name of the [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/7 camp I belong to] to \"Property Dualism\".

Phenomenal properties can\'t \'arise\' from anything, any more than any other type of properties physical, causal, or phenomenal.

Tonight I spent about 45 minutes hunting hunting hunting for a way to do it and finally I figured out that the secret is THERE\'S ANOTHER PAGE TO USE THAT\'S NOT MENTIONED IN YOUR INSTRUCTIONS (*after* going to the \"manage/edit camp link on the ELN theory camp page\", there\'s apparently another link necessary to click on).  Except I\'m not 100% certain it worked because making the change didn\'t have any practical effect except for a note at http://canonizer.com/manage.asp/88/33?class=camp that indicates it could be changed in another week or so.  This might be the way you designed it to work so I left it in this state, please correct it if it is wrong.\r\n\r\nAs the developer I\'m sure it all makes sense to you but you should realize your functionality is more or less opaque to us end-users and the management scheme is not intuitive.  You have a really good idea going here but there needs to be a better way for us to accomplish things.  Quite some time ago for example I tried to make a minor edit with the result that my camp just entirely disappeared, fortunately I had saved the text and was able to re-enter it.  Later I made another entry referencing ELN theory under the \"What is God?\" topic or camp and sometime later it too just entirely disappeared, but I can\'t keep checking the integrity of the website and chasing after every such accident so I\'m not adding anything else until I know it all works as it should and I\'m not going to lose work.  Clicking on some links does bizarre things (\"clear browser\" logs me out?  WTF kind of random damage is that doing I wonder when there\'s already a logout link?).  So I have gotten the impression whether it\'s true or not that this system is still rather fragile in its newness and best left untouched, or at best I\'ll add a comment to a forum thread, at least when it is possible to find one; for example someone left a comment about ELN Theory a while back that I got by email and later wanted to respond to, but I could never find it on the website and I don\'t have the original email any longer to help me do so.  Is that comment completely gone now or is there just no link to it from my camp?  Or is someone editing out stuff and not saying so?  Could it have gone into the \"test server\" instead of production?  (sometimes like tonight this ominous message appears: \"WARNING: This is only the test server. Any submissions will occasionally be overwritten with data copied from the main server.\")\r\n\r\nI get the concept of what you\'re trying to do here and I think it\'s great but I hate going to a lot of work like I did tonight just to do something that should be extremely simple and finding it baffling, almost concealed, and even when I think I\'ve finally found it, it\'s still unclear if I got it right.  Or worse, going to a lot of work only to have it all vanish on me as in the \"What is God?\" topic or camp (it\'s not clear sometimes which is which).  \r\n\r\nOne thing that\'s left me puzzled is that under every Topic (it is clear what topics and camps are when they are labeled) there is an \"Agreement\" camp.  Yet that \"Agreement\" camp isn\'t treated like the other camps but as a sort of path to the other camps, very puzzling and seemingly unnecessary since there are no \"Disagreement\" camps, at least none that I have seen.  If \"Agreement\" is not going to show up as a Camp under Topics, why call it a Camp, indeed why have it at all?\r\n\r\nAnother very baffling thing is the \"Canonized List for <dropdown list> namepace:\" control on the canonizer homepage with all those seemingly random choices (i.e. /professional services/ brings up a question about who is the best family dentist).  What on earth are all those categories of things for, and why do they not show up on the main (homepage) list of topics/camps?  Who is maintaining that list?  Is it just Spammers creating those topics/camps?  How on earth did that fool Maurer get listed as a \"mind expert\" there?  Who is Oscar Jesperson and why are there links to his family videos?  Is most of that stuff just old development test content that should be cleaned out?  The randomness of the things on that list is just completely baffling to me, and I can\'t be the only one wondering about them.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I think might help is if you could separate in the left navigation those functions which are generic (help, account info, some of the others but it\'s not clear which, they don\'t all seem to work) from those that are specific to working on the site such as adding and modifying Topics and Camps, which should all be grouped together under some functional header like \"Topics & Camps\".  Navigation also belongs at the top of the left column, not the bottom; \"Identity\" does not belong in the left navigation at all but should go at the upper right corner of every page with fewer links, and there is no need for a Web search option since anyone can go to Google for that.

We can see the causal properties of the neural correlate of red, via cause and effect observation.  And we must be able to \'eff\' these additional phenomenal properties once we start doing whatever it is neurons, the corpus callosum, and all, are doing to unify these properties into the same conscious awareness working space.  And when we ask such a phenomenal working space if a particular new substance being integrated into it for the first time, with the rest of what it phenomenally experiences, surely the results will be very phenomenally consistent, predictable, and causal.\r\n\r\nOnly whatever it is that is or has red, will reliably cause us to experience, know and say: \'yes, that is my red\'.

Since, I can\'t imagine how we can jump from a \"quality\" of light subjectively experienced by pure consciousness (or unconditioned awareness)â€”that must be absolutely stationary (thus, an immaterial singular point of view) in order to discriminate the exact frequency of the particular \"red\" we see (as distinguished from millions of other colors)â€”to an \"objective\" material substance that must be in constant vibratory motion in itselfâ€”which would certainly interfere with the \"red\" light frequency we experience.  \r\n\r\nI also cannot imagine how separate physical substances could express each of those millions if not billions of subtly different color frequencies in the brain\'s neural system?  \r\n\r\nAs a chemical Engineer and organic chemist with a vast experience in the field of visual information communicationâ€”I have no knowledge of any material substances, down to the quantum particles themselves that could have such individually distinguishable properties. It\'s like you\'re saying that the color \"chromium yellow\" or \"cadmium red\" is a property of the chromium or cadmium compound that reflects it, and that such reflection is also part of a molecular substance in the brain that detects it. This makes no sense whatsoever, and violates every rule of physical- or electrochemistry. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I\'m inclined to believe that the camps of \"Functional Property Dualism\" and \"Material Property Dualism\" are both barking up trees -- since neither of them understands the real difference between subjectivity and objectivity, nor do they have any logically scientific understanding of the nature of the information of consciousness (that links them together) as distinguished from them both. Nor have they offered any rational arguments explaining how those three independent yet complementary aspects of overall spacetime reality, i.e., subjective consciousness, vibratory information, and objective matter, can be conflated or considered as a single objective or subjective phenomena (qualia)?\r\n\r\nIn any event, considering that \"red\" or any particular color can be a substance in itself, or that consciousness can be an epiphenomena of either material substance or its neural complexityâ€”is, IMHO, beyond all logical or scientifically philosophical or philosophically scientific understanding. \r\n','2010-05-03 02:08:13','2010-05-03 02:08:13'),(862,96,48,'Lenny,\r\n\r\nI appreciate hearing this different point of view, and you helping me to better understand it.\r\n\r\nSince you referred to these two theories, using their proposed names, it sounds like you agree that these are good names for these theories, even though you think they are \'barking up the wrong tree\'?

This view is fraught with conceptual difficulties. Theophrastus was, perhaps, the first to challenge this view, arguing that it answered no\r\nquestions. If, for example, we hear a bell by way of an inner copy of the sound, he argued, then the problem would still confront us, for we would have to explain how we hear this \"inner bell.\" Thousands of years later, BF Skinner would echo these sentiments, and some  decades later the emerging philosophy called \"embodied cognition\"\r\nwould come to the same conclusion (all while arguing vociferously that they are not behaviorists)! \r\n\r\n\r\nRepresentationalism and the infinite regress\r\n\r\nIf, for example, seeing requires a copy (or a distorted representation of the thing seen - not necessarily a copy) we can certainly not argue that it is the copy that is seen. Why? Because seeing requires copies, and therefore the copy would have to be copied (since seeing requires \r\ncopies). The second-order copy would, in turn, require another copy and\\ so forth. The only way out of this is to argue that there is a kind of seeing that does not require copies. But if there is a kind of seeing  that does not require copies, why can\'t we see the world with this kind  of seeing? Now, one might argue that the inner copies do not require \r\ncopies, but this is simply a gratuitous assertion designed to salvage an obviously flawed position.\r\n\r\n\r\nRepresentationalism as \"homunculism.\"\r\n\r\nPeople see, hear, feel, smell etc. This is the way language works. But the representationalists want the freedom to alter the meaning of words to suit their philosophical preconceptions. People are embedded in a world, and they see (or hear, or feel etc.) it according to ordinary usage.\r\nBut in the fanciful world of the representationalist, what is seen is a representation in the alleged mind or real brain. Since most representationalists claim to be materialists, I will stick with the notion that what is seen is a representation in the brain. But this is odd. It is odd because when we say,\r\nfor example, that \"John saw Mary\" it goes without saying that John has eyes that are involved in this process, as well as a reasonably intact brain etc. But if what is seen is in the brain, we must inquire as to where the eyes are located and where the, err, sub-brain parts are located etc. An instant of \r\nreflection makes it clear that representationalism requires a part of the brain to have the same properties as the whole person. There must be the equivalent of eyes in the brain, and their must be an equivalent of the brain in the brain.\r\nIn short, there must be an equivalent of a person in the brain. This, of course, then raises the spectre of the infinite regress! Recently Bennett and Hacker have echoed this sentiment, introducing the notion of the \"mereological fallacy.\"\r\nMereology is the study of the relation of parts to wholes, and the mereological fallacy is the notion that a part of a whole has the same properties of the whole. An important point is that Skinner has made these exact sorts of claims - but\r\neveryone knows that Skinner is passe, no? \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is perception?\r\n\r\nBehaviorists (at least Skinnerians) have always held that \"perception is behavior.\" It is a form of action, not representation. Recently, this view has become de rigueur in the emerging philosophy of \"embodied cognition.\" Kevin O\'Regan and Alva Noe (O&N) have described perception in terms of \"sensorimotor contingencies\" and this view characterizes the \"embodied cognition\" view of perception. According to this view, perception is action that emerges because movements (i.e., behavior) are correlated with changes in the stimulation of the sensory receptors; that is,\r\nmovements have consequences. In this case they have sensory consequences. Though O&N have struggled to distance themselves from the behaviorism that they are\r\naccused of supporting, the notion of sensorimotor contingencies is indistinguishable from the notion of \"reinforcement contingencies.\" Much work needs to be done, both conceptually and experimentally, but it is clear that this view avoids the serious problems attendant with representationalism.

Are qualia important? And if so, do you think a red quale is a property of the surface of a strawberry reflecting 700nm light, or instead a property of our knowledge of such, or something else entirely, or not important...??\"  \r\n\r\nA few thoughts here.  First, I confess that I am not really grasping the meaning of Qualia.  For instance, the most basic definition I can find for the word suggests that it simply means \"what something is like.\"  Also, it seems to have some root connection to the word \"quality\" which suggests that it refers to the specific character of a thing, or possibly the depth of character for one individual as compared to another individual\'s perception.  By perusing the Representational  Qualia Theory camp page, I came across the very brief statement \"Qualia represent.\"  Why not simply use the word representation, then?  The short answer i find in the camp page is that this does not accurately reflect the mechanics of the phenomenal portion of the perception, yet I somehow don\'t see how the use of an obscure word makes the explanation any clearer.  Then again, maybe that is just me.  \r\n\r\nBut back to your question about a red quale being representational or specifically the result of 700nm light.  Imagine a single red strawberry placed before a white background.  Observing this strawberry are two human individuals, and two video cameras from different manufacturers.  Before I even get into the observations of the human participants, lets discuss the videos.  If the video from each is played back on an identical monitor, there will most likely be a variety of differences in hue, contrast, texture detail, etc.  These differences are simply the result of varying circuitry, varying lenses, parts made in china, and any number of slight, even microscopic variations in the manufacturing process.  Now we know that each and every human is unique, having our own fingerprints, retinas, dna, and so forth.  This is true even of identical twins. Why then is our difference in perception attributed to a problem of consciousness, rather than the simple and obvious fact of our differences in circuitry and construction?  \r\n\r\nThat is not to say that there is no \"phenomenal\" component in our perception.  But, here is where I have a problem with Representational Qualia Theory.  It seems, at first, to embrace the idea of a spirit, but then qualifies that statement as \"spirit\" being some phenomenal function of the brain. It calls our skulls \"mortal prison walls\", and says that \"our spirits are still trapped behind this phenomenal veil of perception,\" but, if our consciousness and \"spirit\" are simply biological brain functions, then what exactly is trapped?  What exactly is held in the prison?  It honestly seems as if you are trying to play both sides of the fence with this one.  Either there is a spirit, or there is not.\r\n\r\nAs to whether the study of qualia is even important... I have no real objection to the study of the mechanics of the brain and perception, as far as the biological processes are concerned.  However, I personally find the subject of \"why\" we have consciousness far more compelling than the \"hows\" of individual perception. It is the classic question of the philosophers of old.  \"Why am I here?\"  Quite simply, The Divine Origin stance is, \"You are here to make a choice.  To be for God, or against Him.  To believe God, or reject him.\"  The power of consciousness is in choice, not in perception, not in shades of red or green.  \r\n\r\nBrent also said: \"And do you think such ineffable qualities could ever be comunicated between minds / or spirits? Perhaps such could be done by God, or in some divine way, such that I could find out that your red is more like my green, or something?\"  \r\n\r\nLet me try to rephrase this question the way I think you mean it (correct me if I am wrong).  Do I believe a device could be constructed that would show you what my personal perceptions in such a way that they could be compared to your perceptions?  In a nut shell, yes.  I believe that the biological functions of the senses ultimately boil down to electrical impulses that could be tapped into and shown on a view screen, or perhaps even sent into your mind.  For instance, currently there are retinal transplants that can and do happen, but ultimately, I believe that a technique could be perfected for transplanting entire eyes.  In that situation, I believe that things would look slightly different when viewed through the \"new\" eye, as opposed to the original eye.  Likewise, I believe a method could be conceived of to transfer the impulses from my brain into yours.  This would give you a picture of what I \"view\" through my eyes, but not necessarily a picture of what I \"see.\"  For instance, we are looking at the same cloud in the sky.  You see a rabbit in its form, I see a horse.  Being able to view the cloud through my eyes would not enable you to see the horse.  You would likely still see the rabbit.  You would not feel the emotions that I feel in connection with gazing up at the clouds, and remembering my youth.  You would not hear the scripture, Mark 13:26 \"Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.\"  And, all of these things, the memories, the scripture, are stored in my brain.  But in the end, it is just useless data without the spirit to interpret it, and coalesce it into a coherent picture all in the twinkling of an eye.  I hear your rebuttal already, that this is just a biological function which takes place in another part of the brain, however, life experience has taught me otherwise.  Quite simply, the single most logical and reasonable explanation of consciousness, the existence of man, and all of creation for that matter, is the biblical account.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to more. :)\r\n\r\nLes','2010-05-10 04:34:29','2010-05-10 04:34:29'),(891,1,5,'I changed tis statement because I feel that \"last resort\" is redundant.','2010-05-10 14:54:34','2010-05-10 14:54:34'),(894,96,48,'Hi Les,\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting conversation.  You and I think very differently about things.  Iâ€™ve been around religious people lots, but most of them donâ€™t have much depth or reasoning behind their beliefs, nor do most of them have any interest in discussing things deeply.  So it is fun to have a conversation with someone that thinks deeply on this stuff, and is willing to delve into it fully to help me understand it better.\r\n\r\nAs far as what I mean by â€˜faithlessâ€™, on the surface it is a blatant lack in faith in the ability of man to understand consciousness solely through his intellect.  But it is also so much more than just this, and itâ€™d take forever to cover it all.  So let me see if I can touch on just a few examples to give a general idea.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of your view is that all is dependent on God and man is crap.  Evidently something made man fall from this grace, allegedly his \'choice\'?, and there is some justification for why god is hiding from (many of) us, and from all the evil we know.  It sounds like the purpose is so we can make a choice â€œTo be for God, or against Him.â€ And evidently the ones that want or choose something different end up in hell.  Jesus must condescend to our hellish level and die (rather than him bringing us to his level and living) and a bunch of other stuff that I can never make any sense from.\r\n\r\nAnother view is more that there isnâ€™t yet a God, and with god out of the picture (at least temporarily), all the intractable problems in the above vanish.  First, you can hope that evil is relatively easy to overcome; it can be overcome long before anyone gets even close to god like powers, and that we are on the verge of overcoming the worst ones like isolation and deathâ€¦.  Second, you have no fear that even for God, things (his children / creationsâ€¦) tend to â€˜fallingâ€™ / and or God must descend to our hellish level.  Instead, we can have hope that once we achieve a certain level of power, there will never be any more â€˜fallingâ€™.  We can hope that if there are ever any beings at a lower level, for whatever reason, Gods will not have to hide from them, and Gods will not be required to descend to their hellish level.  Instead we can have faith that Gods could easily uplift anyone to their level.  We donâ€™t have to have hate (or whatever you want to call your and Godâ€™s feeling and behavior towards those that want something different).  We can have hope that we can work to find out what everyone truly wants, and have hope that getting it all for everyone is possible.  So, for as long as anyone is still in hell / and or not getting all that they want, you spend eternity serving them, if necessary, and helping them till they finally fully understand what they really want, and you are able to help them get it.  In other words â€“ universal salvation for all, and nobody ever giving up till it is possible for all.  Instead of man being \'punished\' for his falling sins, he is eternally rewarded for is improvement and making the world a better place abilities, and for his progress towards God...\r\n\r\nSo, in comparison, it seems to me that if any of the former view turns out to be true, it would be the most terrible and hateful thing imaginable.  Believing in any such, instead of being faith, would be the abandonment of faith, and accepting something very terrible instead.\r\n\r\nAs far as â€˜playing both sides of the fenceâ€™ on what spirits are, weâ€™re probably just not communicating very adequately, otherwise it would be perfectly clear.  Donâ€™t let the fact that we occasionally use terms like â€˜spiritâ€™ and â€˜spiritualâ€™ confuse things.  â€˜spiritualâ€™ in this case is simply referring to the ineffable phenomenal qualities of nature, and â€˜spiritâ€™ is just our knowledge of ourselves made out of these phenomenal properties, this knowledge not having any referent.  It is all dependent on the brainâ€¦.  it is also the realization that even if we do have a spirit, independent of the brain, it to is subject to the necessity that it must have knowledge of itself, if it is self aware, whether this knowledge has a referent or not...\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n','2010-05-11 14:19:14','2010-05-11 14:19:14'),(895,1,72,'\r\nHi Mark,\r\n\r\nThat is very Interesting that this camp with about half of the entire support for the formerly consensus Functional Property Dualism parent camp is abandoning that camp!

This entails changes to parts of the model with the clear implication that the changes in question were not completely predicted [or perhaps, predictable] by the brain-body system, thus precipitating a reflexive adjustment to the model as a whole. \r\n\r\nA simple way to put this is that the comparison of before and after caused a \"shock\" to the system because the prediction was not entirely fulfilled by the outcome of some action .

I fear to write too much in one go because people wont read it.\r\n\r\nIn this thread I can give some background. In the camp statement I will try to summarise what I take to be important points.\r\n\r\n* I say that an inherent tendency of all organisations with a *command structure* is to cause many people to be treated as if they are things, at least in part for some of the time, and often to some extent for *all* the time, that those people are contracted to obey commands of the office holders. \r\n\r\n* It is crucial to realise that this applies to all organisations: armies, police forces, government departments, commercial organisations, sports clubs and religious organisations. The clearest examples of course are organised crime gangs and \"families\", and military units obeying the orders of a dictatorship. But militant and murderous religious cults have been around since the dawn of civilisation showing that the hideous crimes committed by sick and twisted fanatics of Jihad, the equally perverse atrocities of the Christian inquisitions, and so forth, are not \"aberrations\" but merely examples of the more extreme end of a common continuum. \r\n\r\nMy slant on the nature of evil crystallised after reading Cape Jugulem [spelling?] one of the Disc World novels by Terry Pratchett, who is of course one of my heroes. I was blown out by the sublime simplicity of a statement he put in the mouth  of Granny Weatherwax. She is the chief witch in an anarchistic coven of feisty non-conformists so, during a cross country journey she is forced to undertake in the company of a fanatical disciple of Om [one of many gods], the two of them conduct a full on and pretty much non-stop argument about religions and philosophy. The haughty disciple of Om sounds off by the campfire one evening and starts on the subject of sin. Granny W responds: \"There is only ONE sin, and that is to treat another person as a thing!\"\r\n\r\nWell that just stopped me in my tracks when I first read it. Considering that comedy is the biggest feature of the Disc world books, and the main reason I think that he has become a millionaire from the writing of them, it is a gem, a pearl beyond price, which shows how much else Terry Pratchett brings to his writing.\r\n\r\nAfter mulling and meditating I have come to see that evil is what happens as and when a person is treated as a thing. It is the essence of evil. We can apply this insight to virtually every situation of human life and if delivers clarity of understanding with practical implications for how many situations can be improved. What is more it allows us to see why our societies are so afflicted by many seemingly intractable problems. I think it is an idea whose time has come and as far as I can see it is an idea of the modern era; it could not be sustained in the pre-scientific  universe even though, of course, it was always true. The reason for that I believe is that before the advent of scientific method on the world scene, not enough [natural] persons could extricate themselves mentally from their cultural worldview to see the possibility of something radically different. In the modern era though sceptical thought is at last attaining recognition as a proper and essential approach to discover of the truth. \r\n\r\nConsider the following: in modern societies various kinds of corporate entities have been given the legal status of \"persons\". In other words, these entities, which otherwise would be groupings and associations of people, have been accorded a form of sovereign right to stand before the law and assert their existence. In the beginning this was allowed as a special privilege in order to protect sponsors and investors from being saddled with the debts of others with whom they combined investment capital. Before the invention of the limited company such investors would have to be in partnership with each other which entailed being individually and severally responsible for all the debts of the partnership. Fear of dying in a debtors prison was a strong incentive NOT to risk one\'s hard won capital on a commercial adventure with that basis. Thus the reason for the creation of legal persons which embody the combined capital of thousands of natural persons is perfectly understandable. \r\n\r\nWhat most people don\'t seem to understand, or just don\'t want to admit, is that limited companies do not feel empathy! Duh - of course not! No reasonable person would say they do. The problem is that the directors of companies, their lawyers, and the many shareholders, all believe that the basic structure and mechanism is benign or at least value free. They believe this while at the same time asserting that the primary function of the company is to make money by \"turning a profit\". By and large all the bigger private companies are ruled by the doctrine that money profit is the aim of the organisation and the measure of its success. Producing money profit is in effect THE PRIMARY VIRTUE compared to which all other considerations are secondary at best. What this ignores is that money is only an accounting system [as yet anyway] which has real meaning and worth ONLY when it matches off consistently, as a representation, against things of real value that is to say the products of human labour. \r\n\r\nThere are many sides to this but the chief one here is that \r\n\r\n* as we substitute money for the actual created good or service we abstract ourselves out of the immediate reality. Furthermore, to the extent that those in positions of power exercise that power over others,  those over [or against] whom the power is used become objectified in the sight of the powerful ones. That is they come to be seen at least in part as things: \"human resources\" rather than personnel. This creates divisions in the mind of the one wielding power, but not acknowledged as such probably. \r\n\r\n* The insidious outcome though, is that, the powerful one looses some of his connection or identity with the rest of humanity. He becomes diminished without realising it. Those who suffer this objectification [us wage slaves for example] lose autonomy and lose authority to make many decisions which directly affect us. This usually leads to stress reactions in the people so affected. If endured for long periods this has the effect of undermining the sufferer\'s immune system resulting in various kinds of chronic illness.\r\n\r\nThat is enough to go on with\r\n\r\nMark','2010-05-17 16:48:46','2010-05-17 16:48:46'),(902,96,48,'Theoreticians,\r\n\r\nStuart Hameroff has expresses interest in helping us integrate \'\'\'Penrose-Hameroff Orchestrated Objective Reduction(Orch OR) theory\'\'\' into the consciousness survey project.

In a subsequent reply I\'ll summarize the discussions we\'ve had so far about the best way to integrate this into the current structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Camp Name: \'\'\'Orch OR\'\'\'\r\n* Camp Title: \'\'\'Penrose-Hameroff Orchestrated Objective Reduction(Orch OR) theory\'\'\'\r\n* Statement:\r\n\r\nPenrose-Hameroff â€˜Orch ORâ€™ is a theory of consciousness which grew from a confluence of two originally separate theories.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1982, Stuart Hameroff and colleagues had proposed that brain activities supporting consciousness were not limited to synaptic-level information processing in neuronal networks (as other theories suggest), but also extended downward to include computation in intra-neuronal cytoskeletal structures, specifically microtubules. \r\n\r\nBut while microtubule computation would increase capacity and speed of brain information processing (~10^15 operations per second per neuron), there was no accounting for consciousness per se, i.e. the nature of phenomenal experience, known now as the â€˜hard problemâ€™.\r\n \r\nIn 1989 Sir Roger Penrose proposed that consciousness is a sequence of quantum computations, each terminated by a particular form of quantum state reduction occurring due to a specific objective threshold (hence â€˜objective reductionâ€™ â€“ OR) related to quantum gravity. Quantum computing requires information (e.g. binary bits of either 1 or 0) to exist transiently as quantum superposition of both 1 and 0 (quantum bits, or â€˜qubitsâ€™). \r\n\r\nBut while Penrose OR provided a mechanism for consciousness, it lacked a specific superpositioned qubit for OR-mediated quantum computing.  Penrose conjectured that neurons could perhaps exist as superposition of both firing and not firing. But neurons are fairly macroscopic.\r\n\r\nHameroff suggested to Penrose that microtubules might be the quantum computers in the brain he was searching for, and that objective reduction might be the mechanism Hameroff was seeking. In 1994 Penrose and Hameroff met for several weeks in Denmark and began to hatch a theory of OR-mediated quantum computing in brain microtubules. \r\n\r\nPenrose had proposed that OR occurred as E=h/t, where E is the gravitational self energy of the superposition, h is Planckâ€™s constant over 2 pi, and t is the time at which OR moments of consciousness occurred. So the larger the superposition E, the quicker the superposition would reach threshold for OR and consciousness at time t. \r\n\r\nE=h/t is related to the quantum indeterminacy principle, and similar to the equation describing photons of the electromagnetic spectrum. If h is replaced by the speed of light c, E would be the energy of a photon, and t its wavelength. Penrose OR was describing a spectrum of conscious moments.  \r\n\r\nFor consciousness in the brain, Penrose and Hameroff began by defining t in electrophysiological terms, e.g. related to the EEG (2 to 100 Hz; 10 to 500 milliseconds). They then calculated and found that superposition of microtubules in roughly hundreds of thousands, to millions of brain neurons was required for OR to occur in concert with EEG frequency bands correlating with consciousness (in particular, gamma synchrony at 30 to 90 Hz). OR quantum computations were â€˜orchestratedâ€™ by synaptic inputs, hence â€˜orchestrated objective reduction, Orch OR. \r\n\r\nQuestions abounded. How did the quantum computations in microtubules avoid decoherence in the warm, wet biological environment? How could quantum states isolated in one neuron extend throughout the brain? How could isolated quantum states receive inputs and provide outputs to the external, classical world? How could Orch OR solve the â€˜hard problemâ€™ of conscious experience?\r\n\r\nRegarding the â€˜hard problemâ€™, P&H (1996) proposed that precursors of phenomenal experience were embedded in the fundamental level of the universe â€“ spacetime geometry at the Planck scale, described through quantum gravity. Orch OR connected brain processes to the most basic level of the universe, and is thus consistent in a philosophical framework with neutral monism. \r\n\r\nIn 1998 Hameroff published 20 testable predictions of Orch OR, and reviewed their status in 2007. A number have been validated, and none refuted. To accommodate extension of quantum microtubule states throughout the brain, Orch OR predicted that gap junctions- windows between cells which allowed continuous internal cytoplasmic states â€“ would be important for the neural correlate of consciousness. Indeed, gap junctions have been shown to be involved in gamma synchrony EEG, the best brain marker of consciousness. \r\n\r\nExtensions of Orch OR include the â€˜Conscious pilotâ€™ model, developed by Hameroff to describe a gap junction-defined mobile zone of executive agency and Orch OR-mediated consciousness moving through the brain, and topological qubits in which winding pathways in microtubules (rather than individual microtubule subunits) function as qubits. Hameroff has further conjectured that consciousness as a process in fundamental spacetime geometry (in which Platonic values may be embedded, as suggested by Penrose) can account for various spiritual phenomena (interconnectedness, access to cosmic wisdom, and even after-life). \r\n\r\nOrch OR has been criticized since its inception along several lines, especially the question of quantum states in the warm, wet biological environment. Recent demonstrations of quantum coherence in photosynthesis at ambient temperatures show that biology avoids decoherence. \r\n\r\nTo date, no facts or evidence have contradicted proposals supporting Orch OR. Testable and falsifiable, Orch OR remains the most complete, detailed and promising theory of consciousness ever put forward.\r\n\r\n\'\'\'More Info:\'\'\' [http://www.quantumconsciousness.org www.quantumconsciousness.org]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2010-05-24 00:05:10','2010-05-24 00:05:10'),(905,96,48,'Consciousness Theoreticians,\r\n\r\nIn the e-mail discussion Stuart and I have had so far, I enumerated some of the key doctrines of the \'\'\'Representational Qualia Theory\'\'\' (and some of the difference between functional and material property dualism).  He indicated he was in agreement with many of them.  Apparently, the most significant disagreement is around this doctrine:\r\n\r\n    \"* A red qualia is not a property of the strawberry reflecting 700nm light,\r\n    but rather is a property of our knowledge of such.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Stuart responded:\r\n\r\n    \"No\r\n    Qualia are properties of spacetime geometry, embedded at the Planck scale,\r\n    but recurring in scale holographically. Specifically, certain regions of\r\n    spacetime geometry correlating with quantum computations in microtubules\r\n    inside brain neurons are conscious at any given moment.\"\r\n\r\nThen I asked:\r\n\r\n    \"Would I be right in saying our knowledge of say a red strawberry was \r\n    phenomenal properties of spacetime geometry, embedded at the Planck \r\n    scale, but recurring in scale holographically?\"\r\n\r\nStuart Responded:\r\n\r\n    \"Not sure what you mean by knowledge.\r\n    I would say our conscious experience of...\"\r\n\r\nAnd this is where I wanted to move the discussion to this forum, to hopefully get participation from all of you on this issue.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of \'\'\'Orch OR\'\'\' so far is that the final result of our eyes detecting the 700nm light reflected from a point on the surface of the strawberry is a set of one or more neurons with something, probably microtubules in a quantum space-time geometry configuration such that it results in us having a red experience representing that one 3D point or voxel of the surface of the strawberry.  Along with this there are a bunch of other similarly quantum configured neurons, or microtubules of such, representing the red points on the rest of the surface of the strawberry at the appropriate relative 3D locations to the first.  Unified with all this would be some differently configured space time geometry that has our subjective green, at the appropriate 3D locations such that they are the brain\'s conscious knowledge of the leafs.\r\n\r\nA computer configured in a way that it could have the same amount of knowledge of the strawberry patch, sufficient for it to equally intelligently pick the strawberry, could be a set of voxel elements using ones and zeros to represent red and green.  Of course since these elements would not be unified into anything like a conscious awareness, the algorithm that would enable the system to select the red strawberry from the green leaves would require some kind of searching through the entire set of voxels to find the red ones, and recording the location as representing the location to which to move the robot hand to pick the strawberry.  Obviously all this is simplified and trivialized - but it represents the general possibility.\r\n\r\nI think this is all in complete agreement with the much more general \'\'\'Representational Qualia Theory\'\'\' and this is why I think \'\'\'Orch OR\'\'\' belongs as a supporting sub camp to it.\r\n\r\nStuarts proposed statement includes:\r\n\r\n    \"To date, no facts or evidence have contradicted proposals\r\n    supporting \'\'\'Orch OR\'\'\'.  Testable and falsifiable, \'\'\'Orch OR\'\'\'\r\n    remains the most complete, detailed and promising theory of\r\n    consciousness ever put forward.\"\r\n\r\nI believe this claim is true and I believe that most competing theories, most of which are not yet represented in this survey topic, cannot be true because they cannot make this claim.  They all have one or more fatal flaws or inconsistencies with what we know to be true.  So, if my understanding of \'\'\'Orch OR\'\'\', as stated above, is correct, I believe it to be one of the best possible theories that science could still demonstrably prove to be true.\r\n\r\nSo, if all this is true, and if \'\'\'Orch OR\'\'\' is placed as a supporter to the \'\'\'Representational Qualia Theory\'\'\' camp, then I would like to join and support the \'\'\'Orch OR\'\'\' theory camp as being one of the few good remaining contenders for what science could prove to be true.  However, this would be my second place camp or theory at this level, as I think another theory about what qualia are, perhaps Steven Lehar\'s where the phenomenal qualities exist as simple subjective properties of macro level already quantum collapsed matter.  Steven Lehar\'s wave theory, for example, would count as another theoretical possibility that is yet to be falsified, and one which I currently prefer to thinking quantum level complexity is required.\r\n\r\nSo, graphically, I\'m thinking along the lines of this structure:\r\n\r\n    [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6 Representational Qualia Theory]\r\n        [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/7 Material Property Dualism]\r\n            \'\'\'Orch OR\'\'\'\r\n            \'\'\'Non Quantum Material Property Dualism\'\'\'\r\n\r\nWith the Non Quantum camp being my current first choice, and \'\'\'Orch OR\'\'\' being an equally possible second choice theory that I would also join and support.  I believe, eventually, one of these would be demonstrably falsified by effing scientific results, and at that time I would abandon whatever it turned out to be.\r\n\r\nThis is just one point of view.  Am I making any mistakes?  Are there any competing points of view?  What are everyone\'s thoughts on this proposal, and most importantly, would any current or possible future members of these camps object to having \'\'\'Orch OR\'\'\' integrated into the POV structure in this way?  In other words, does this structure have a camp that you would agree with, along with all the doctrines of all the parent camps of that camp?  And remember, silence implies consent, and that you will not object to such integrating changes.

This is a problem in comparative analog spherical geometry (similar to our GPS network) that no physical/material theory of perceptive/responsive consciousness (awareness, will, qualia, etc.) can solve by any stretch of the imagination.\r\n\r\nObviously, thenâ€”the conscious perceiver\'s point of perception also must be absolutely stationary in order to discern and discriminate between the infinite frequency modulations that determine the colors, tints, tones and shades of the near-infinitely complex visual and/or audio images perceived. \r\n\r\nTherefore, consciousness (awareness, will, qualia, etc.) can only be a quality of that static zero-point of absolute empty space whose ZP spin momentum must underlie, generate and empower ALL radiant fields that are the basis of all ponderable forms of matterâ€”down to the quantum particle-standing waves themselves... As Einstein said, \"Energy is simply space in (vibratory and radiant linear) motion\". (My parenthesis.)\r\n\r\nThis also implies that the mind and memory fieldsâ€”which carry the intermediate information of conscious perception and thoughtâ€”must be separate entities, entirely independent of the brain\'s neural structures and their electrochemical processes (other than being superficially and relatively temporarily modified by them).\r\n\r\nSo, it isn\'t \"representationalism\" whose logic is fallacious -- but those who believe that consciousness, mind and memory (either working, short or long term) can be explained in terms of physical properties of the brain, or described in scientific language or its renormalized mathematics. \r\n\r\nTherefore, there is no \"infinite regress\" just like there is no \"homunculus\"â€”in the sense that some if not most \"representationalists\" believe... Since the conscious perceiver IS the individual self consciousness (awareness and will) located at the zero-point center of the entire body fieldâ€”which self consciousness is entangled with every zero-point of localized consciousness at the center of each cellular and each separate organ field... All, interpenetrating each other holonomically... Which accounts for the non-locality of experiential consciousness (i.e., the feeling of a pain or itch at the end of a finger and the instantaneous knowing of its 3-d coordinate location relative to the entire body structure).  [The only delay being the time it takes the brain-body to respondâ€”which is all that the neuroscientists can measure]    \r\n\r\nSo, as far as representationalism is concernedâ€”it is essentially a valid viewpoint... Only that it cannot be a materialist oneâ€”since consciousness is not any part of the dormant or dead (although potentially conscious) matter it perceives and can wilfully manipulate... (With the matter itself having nothing to say or think about it. ;-)\r\n\r\nObviously, then, it\'s not \"People\" who \"see, hear, feel, smell etc., and use language... But their individual cellular centers and global \"I am\" consciousnessâ€”which (as part of the same absolute space) forever remains outside of matter and its lowest order, relative space-time physical/material \"light\" energy fieldsâ€”whose velocity is limited to \"c\" and whose ponderable forms can only be experienced through the \"light\" energy that they reflect. \r\n\r\nTherefore, representationalism is alive and kicking... But, only if we accept the new paradigm of physics that sees consciousness as a fundamental quality of the underlying absolute (0Â°K) zero-point space that underlies all the harmonics of hyperspherical space-time fields as well as their ponderable material formsâ€”from galaxies and stars down to sub-quantum particles and all forms of sentient beings, up to our own individual brain-bodies... Whose consciousness forever (whether the lowest order body structures are alive or dead) remains connected to their highest order monadic fields (which mystics call our \"aura\").

Supporting sub camps is different, in that your entire vote also supports all parent camps.  It is not counted as splitting your vote.\r\n\r\nPutting the Hameroff camp as a supporting sub camp, instead of a competing camp, as you have done, gives people that only support these two an advantage as they get a bit more of a vote by not splitting their vote into two competing camps.\r\n\r\nBut for the more important \'mind experts\' algorithm this is not the case, since it has a punishing factor for experts that only support themselves.

And, I certainly can\'t imagine how an infinite regress has anything to do with our experiencing of such an image.  Even though that experience seems to be located at a single point of view in the center of our head behind the eyes and between the ears, or at the exact focal point in the center of the brain wave EM field recorded by an EEG.  \r\n\r\nSo, unless such images are carried as modulated wave interference patterns on that field and transmitted resonantly down to that singular stationary POV by simple harmonic resonance -- I am still waiting for someone in the representational camp to tell me how the brain distinguishes between almost infinitely different colors, tints, tones and shades, how such qualities of light are separated and perceived by the brain\'s neural structures as if they all were at a single point of observation, and how the brain becomes conscious (aware) of the differences, or uniquely experiences their particular qualia at that point?  \r\n\r\nIOW, what is the physical nature of the brain\'s chemistry or its structure that enables it to experience a particular color, tint, tone or shade at any point in the total visual image as being a different qualia than any other point within the total holographic image perceived.  And, specifically, what is the physical nature of the representation in the brain that replicates any specific quality of the light image reflected from the object of perception? e.g.; What is the difference between the green color replica in brain, and the red color replica, and how do we perceive their different qualia?\r\n\r\nSeems to me that, so far, without answers to those questions all such claims That consciousness can be explained \"in terms of physical properties of the brain, or described in scientific language...\" are simply guesses that have no basis in either logical explanation or evidential facts.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, since I believe (having logically proved and demonstrated by mind and other experiments) that all visual information of consciousness, before and after electrochemical processing by the brain\'s neurology, is carried as holographic wave interference patterns (holograms) on radiant electromagnetic fields (and their resonant harmonics)â€”and that awareness-will, as pure subjectivity, are fundamental qualities of primal, pre-cosmic or absolute spaceâ€”which is ubiquitously located at every ZPE source of every radiant field throughout total spacetime...  \r\n\r\nTherefore, It\'s perfectly obvious to me that all theories claiming that consciousness is an epiphenomena of the brain\'s neurology or its processes, or that consciousness can be explained \"in terms of physical properties of the brain (including some which claim that colors are a property of the brain) or described in scientific language...\" are entirely mistaken guesses... As is naive realism, or any idea that claims subjective consciousness (awareness, will, qualia, etc.) may be behavioral processes in themselves, or the results of them.\r\n\r\nSo, what good is a canonizer that only rates and gives credence to what we believe in, rather than what we can rationally explain or prove?  As far as I can see, the numbers giving the representational camp the lead over all other theories of consciousness and mind are meaningless.\r\n\r\nSo, even though my ABC theory of cosmogenesis, consciousness and mind is representational, in that the perceived images of consciousness are brain processed representations of the objects of perception (as information carried by electromagnetic fields)â€”they are not material aspects or products of the brain, its neurology or chemistry, nor can they create or experience consciousness (awareness, will, qualia, etc.)... Therefore, I cannot include its camp as a subcamp of the representational camp or any subcamp in it.  \r\n\r\nLeon Maurer\r\n','2010-05-29 06:13:42','2010-05-29 06:13:42');

What â€œjournal publishersâ€ have made infinite regress arguments to you? Representationalism is all but ubiquitous with virtually the only dissenters being (1) radical behaviorists, (2) â€œGibsonians,â€ and (3)  the new Gibsonians who dub their position â€œembodied cognitionâ€ (EC).  No doubt radical behaviorists would be censored by many journals,  but the EC people have hidden (most of the time even from themselves!) that their position is essentially behavioristic. Indeed, when Oâ€™Regan and Noe published their tome in BBS, several commentators denounced their position as â€œjust behaviorism.â€  Not much substantive comment was then necessary; to simply accuse someone of behaviorist leanings was deemed sufficient to refute their argument! Such is the case in mainstream psychology and the myriad of fields that it has corrupted. Butâ€¦I have rambled some, and gotten ahead of myselfâ€¦the main point for now is that representational is now, and has always been, the dominant view of everything psychological. It starts with the seeing of representations and moves seamlessly to the storing and retrieving of representations.  Similar to this is the notion that â€œknowledgeâ€ is stored in some sort of equivalent of propositions.\r\n\r\nBrent wrote:\r\n\r\nI\'m in the camp that believes consciousness can be explained \"in terms of physical properties of the brain, or described in scientific language...\" and I believe Glen is making this infinite regress argument because Glen doesn\'t yet fully understand \"Representational Qualia Theory\" \r\n\r\nIt simply predicts that \'seeing\' has two critical parts.

This in no way implies that you need some infinite regress that has knowledge of that knowledge forever - for either the robot or us. \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Brent, your position doesnâ€™t â€œpredictâ€ anything - its adherents simply assume what they later argue is demonstrated. Second, I see nothing in what you said that â€œI didnâ€™t understand.â€ Arguing that the robotâ€™s â€œmodelâ€ is â€œrepresented abstractly by ones and zeros,â€ is utterly beside the point. It is not the nature of the representation that is at issue. What is at issue is that any term you want to use to describe what is done with the alleged representation will be some other term that refers to the behavior of the whole organism. The charge of â€œinfinite regressâ€ is the same as the charge of â€œhomunculismâ€ which is the same as Bennett and Hackerâ€™s â€œmereological fallacy.â€ Third, surely your â€œâ€¦our representations are representedâ€¦â€ is a misstatement? You must have meant â€œour representations of the world areâ€¦â€ . No? In any event your claim that â€œrepresentations are phenomenalâ€ simply assumes what you claim to show. Say you build a robot that shows a phototropic response. An array of directional photosensitive transducers drive the mechanism such that the wheels on the side opposite the light source turn more than those that are ipsilateral. When the stimulation is equal, the thing goes to the light source. Any alleged â€œrepresentationâ€ is utterly gratuitous. Further down this thread, Lehar will claim that all robots that have some kind of video camera or other sensory device are an â€œexistence proofâ€ of the â€œprincipleâ€ of representationalism. I say this is nonsense; to say that the phototropic robot I have described is somehow â€œusing a representationâ€ is to simply interpret all sensory phenomena - and ultimately all phenomena - in terms of the core assumption! If I turn on a flashlight is the resulting light a representation? What is it a representation of? The phototropic robot is simply a sort of complicated switching device. The wheels are driven by light, to say that it is really driven by a representation of the light invites the notion that all causation is really â€œrepresentation,â€ but perhaps that is what you wish to argue? And your â€œIf you know something (whether you see it or not), there must be something that is that knowledge.â€ pretty much illustrates what I have been saying. The â€œmust beâ€ implies some sort of logical machinery behind the declaration, but I see none. What I see is that you have simply assumed the same sort of principle that you claim to show. The motion of an old locomotiveâ€™s wheels are not a representation of the coal in the burner.  A fourth issue, and what underlies the whole conceptual morass that is mainstream-psychology-and-the-fields-it-has-corrupted, is its insensitivity to the normative use of language; i.e., that which dictates â€œsenseâ€ and â€œnonsense.â€ How is the word â€œknowâ€ actually used? This may be contrasted with other things that are said about â€œknowledge being a thing,â€ and other sorts of locutions that have an origin in arcane philosophies. The word â€œknowâ€ in ordinary usage is, at the heart of it, simply a reference to doing. A person that hits a baseball â€œknows how to hit a baseball.â€  Similarly, a person that â€œknows Einstein published a paper in 1905â€ is a person that says â€œEinstein publishedâ€¦â€. The word is also used in the context of statements logically-derived from locutions that stem from observations of behavior; a person that tries a door, finds it locked, and immediately lifts the mat and retrieves a key â€œmust have known there is a key there.â€  Finally, as to Brentâ€™s last paragraph, I reiterate that the whole idea underlying this forum is a logical fallacy, i.e., the argumentum ad populum. It simply does not matter (from the standpoint of generating science and cogent philosophies) how many people agree with me. And, as I have said, your assertion that representationalism is, or was, some sort of â€œdowntroddenâ€ upstart simply does not jibe with even a cursory examination of the history of philosophy and psychology.\r\n\r\nLehar writes:\r\n\r\nThe problem with the *infinite regress* argument is that if you refute it once, soundly, irrefutably, with extensive elaboration, the argument keeps coming back again and again as if it had never been refuted! There\'s an infinite regress for you! \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nLehar seems to conflate â€œrefutationâ€ with â€œcogent refutation.â€  He has always simply assumed representationalism, and then proceeded to interpret any and all observations from within that framework. I remember - even without looking back at the links Lehar has provided - that Lehar once said something very close to â€œIf we see a 3-d world, there MUST be a 3-d representation.â€ This says it all, in my opinion. Representationalism is, and always has been, an assumption within which observations are interpreted. \r\n\r\nLehar writes: \r\n\r\nFor those on the sidelines, the oft-restated refutation of the infinite regress argument can be summarized succinctly thus: \r\n\r\nThere is no need to have a second observer of the internal representation, the representation need only be available to other internal mechanisms and processes in the brain, not to a miniature copy of the whole brain.\r\n\r\nGlen responds: \r\n\r\nThe â€œneedâ€ for a â€œsecond observerâ€ is embedded in language use, and it is language that must â€œtake a holidayâ€ (c.f. Wittgenstein) in order that this be acceptable. Ultimately, representationalism holds that we do not see the world, we see a representation. Lehar wants to disguise this by avoiding the use of the term â€œseeâ€ a second time. Say he did not avoid this (as he did not in the â€œquoteâ€ that I remember - I do not know whether the quote appears in the links; I am purposely responding prior to looking there - also, I admit that what I have attributed to Lehar may not be a direct quote, but it is very, very close). Then what he is saying is that there are two kinds of seeing. Seeing the world requires a copy, but seeing the copy does not. But if there is a kind of seeing that does not require a copy, then why is this not the â€œkind of seeingâ€ that characterizes the whole person (or nonhuman animal) when we say things like â€œJohn saw the ball coming at his head.â€ But he does avoid the use of â€œseeâ€ a second time; instead he writes: â€œthe representation need only be available to other internal mechanisms and processes in the brain, not to a miniature copy of the whole brain.â€ But this is simply an ad hoc assertion whose sole purpose is to derail arguments concerning the implications of the other things he says. If seeing requires eyes and a brain (not to mention the whole muscular system that is involved in moving the eyes - a prerequisite for almost all vision), then seeing a copy must require internal eyes and a brain-within-the-brain. That is simply a logical conclusion. But Lehar will have none of that. He wants to have his cake and eat it too. The logical implications of representationalism are clear and they do not simply disappear because one says that they do. Big Brother said â€œwar is peaceâ€ but that does not make it so.\r\n\r\nLehar writes:\r\n\r\nThe *principle* behind representationalism is demonstrated by every robot that responds to sensory input provided by a video camera or other sensory device, where the image is read and responded to by internal algorithmic mechanisms. Robots provide an *existence proof* of the feasibility of the *principle* of representationalism. \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nI have already discussed this in my reply to Brent, but it is worth repeating: if the phototropic robot that I describe can be said to have a â€œrepresentation,â€ then ALL causation can be framed in this way. What is gained? It is the light that controls the behavior of the robot I described, not a representation of the light. \r\n\r\nLehar writes: \r\n\r\nIf you disconnect the video cable between the camera and the computer, the computer no longer has access to the internal representation of external reality, and the robot becomes blind. The same happens to a human if you sever the optic nerve. The internal representation of external reality *is* required for humans and robots to see.

The principle of direct perception has *never* been demonstrated in *any* artificial or robotic mechanism, because it is impossible in *principle*. \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nIâ€™m sorry, but this is nonsense; it is simply another example of implying that ALL causation is â€œrepresentation.â€ If you sever the connection between the photocells and the motor in the robot I described it is blind. Similarly, if you sever any of the three neurons that are involved in the postural reflexes that are evidenced by the â€œknee jerk,â€ the lower leg is â€œblindâ€ to the hammerâ€˜s fall. But do you really want to say that the fall of the little rubber hammer is â€œrepresentedâ€ by the neural activity? And if so, then the light that comes out of my flashlight is a representation of the chemicals in the battery, or some such rot. And why stop there? Is the movement of the distal end of a stick that is functioning as a lever a representation of the motion applied by the person pushing on the proximate end? Try as you might, the distal end of the lever cannot cause a stone to move if you cut the stick in half.  Q.E.D. representationalism? The principle of direct perception is demonstrated by the robot I described - unless, of course, ALL causation is â€œrepresentation.â€ If that is adhered to then, indeed, it is IMPOSSIBLE to demonstrate â€œdirect perceptionâ€ because it has been defined out of existence! \r\n\r\nRepresentationalism is, and always has been, an assumption, and it is the scourge of mainstream psychology and the fields it has corrupted. Representationalism is not â€œwrongâ€ it is devoid of sense.   ','2010-05-29 13:43:14','2010-05-29 13:43:14'),(936,96,48,'Hi Glen,\r\n\r\nThanks for further explaining your views.

When\r\n    the stimulation is equal, the thing goes to the light source.\r\n    Any alleged â€œrepresentationâ€ is utterly gratuitous.\r\n\r\nI think ALL this is representation, and not gratuitous at all.  We start with the initial cause of the perception process, the surface of the strawberry reflecting 700nm light.  The first causally downstream \'representation\' in the seeing perception process is the reflected 700nm light.  This light is a representation of the strawberry, thought it is not fundamentally, and surely not phenomenally, anything like the strawberry.  In order to get a representation of the strawberry from the light, you must properly interpret the causal properties of the light.  And every other causally downstream representation has the same ineffable problem - they must be properly interpreted to extract the meaning.  This is also true for your phototropic robot.  The transducers must be set up properly, so some causal properties somewhere in the light detection process, even if it is only the light itself, so that it steers the robot.\r\n\r\nAll these causal representations, including the ones that must be interpreted appropriately as ones and zeros, can be considered as abstract knowledge.  Their causal properties can be used to control yet other properties that cause yet more behavior.  The big difference between this and conscious knowledge, is that our knowledge is represented with phenomenal properties of the \'gray matter\' that can be unified together into our world of unified awareness.   Things included in this unified working space include phenomenal representations of us - or our \'spirit\', represented as \'looking\' out of our knowledge of our eyes, at the strawberries - even though this unified phenomenal knowledge of our spirit looking at the strawberries, has no referent in reality.\r\n\r\nYou say: \"The â€œmust beâ€ implies some sort of logical machinery behind the declaration, but I see none.\" and you always only focus on the resulting behavior.  And to me, this is evidence that you don\'t yet fully understand what we are saying.  When we use a digital camera that has an array of pixels that can be one (for red) or zero (for green) we can take a picture of the strawberry patch.  But these digital ones and zeros must be property interpreted as strawberry color and leaf color, before you can have enough knowledge to allow one to pick the strawberry.  Also, instead of digital memory, you could have some phenomenal brain matter or a neural correlate that had a red quale to be used to represent the strawberry, and neural correlate that had a green phenomenal property to represent the leaves.  You would still have to appropriately interpret the red, as the strawberry, and the green, as the leaves, in order to pick the strawberry.  But the big difference is, these representations are phenomenally like something, and red and green are phenomenally very different from each other.  And you don\'t have to have any behavior wired to this conscious knowledge for these phenomenal facts of the matter (there is much more to the representations than just causal properties) to be true.\r\n\r\nHave I converted you to our camp yet? ;)  If not, I hope you get a camp started so I have a good concise reference that will help me better know just what it is you believe, and so I can know just how many people agree with you or like thinking of things in this way.\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n','2010-05-29 18:31:22','2010-05-29 18:31:22'),(939,96,48,'Brent writes: \r\n\r\nHi Glen, \r\nThanks for further explaining your views.

The institutionalized misrepresentation, and de facto censorship, of radical behaviorism is enough to make people want to not be associated in any way with the philosophy. Further, the de facto censorship of behaviorism is so successful, that relatively few people have any understanding of radical behaviorism or behavior analysis.  \r\n\r\nBrent writes: \r\n\r\nI desperately want to know, concisely and quantitatively, what everyone that holds a different point of view believes, in all their subtle differences, and so on.

For you, it appears, there is no causation that is not a kind of representation. I find that a very, very damaging aspect of your position.\r\n\r\nBrent writes: \r\n\r\nWe start with the initial cause of the perception process, the surface of the strawberry reflecting 700nm light. The first causally downstream \'representation\' in the seeing perception process is the reflected 700nm light. \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nSee? For you everything is representation. Soâ€¦I ask again, is the motion of the distal end of a lever a representation of the motion of the proximal end? What ISNâ€™T representation in your view? \r\n\r\nBrent writes: \r\n\r\nThis light is a representation of the strawberry, thought it is not fundamentally, and surely not phenomenally, anything like the strawberry. In order to get a representation of the strawberry from the light, you must properly interpret the causal properties of the light. \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nBut, since everything for you is representation, â€œâ€¦interpret[ing] the causal properties of lightâ€¦â€ must be more representation. Soâ€¦light hits the retina. The receptors â€œfire.â€ These cause other neurons to â€œfire.â€ At some point, however, Iâ€™m guessing that you will claim that â€œinterpretationâ€ takes place. No? But this must have to do with nerves that are in some sense â€œafferentâ€ with respect to the neural representation. There are â€œnerves that go to the representation.â€ But if the nerves are affected in some systematic way by the representation arenâ€™t they simply MORE representation?  What makes one set of firings that are systematically related to the thing seen a representation and some other set â€œinterpretationâ€? After all, we have one seamless series of connections. The light (according to you) is a representation of the object - the light hits the retina and makes another representation and so on. But all there is all the way down is, so to speak, â€œnerves firing as a result of other nerves firing.â€ That all sounds like more representation (by your usage) to me. Doesnâ€™t it to you? \r\n\r\nBrent writes: \r\n\r\nAnd every other causally downstream representation has the same ineffable problem - they must be properly interpreted to extract the meaning. \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nOKâ€¦but of what does this interpretation consist? Does it involve any neurons that â€œreceive informationâ€ from the brain area(s) currently composing the â€œrepresentationâ€ or, I guess, within which the representation is held? What makes these neural firings â€œinterpretationâ€ and not more â€œrepresentation.â€ I guess you might say that what makes these interpretation and not representation is that activity here causes behavior. \r\n\r\n\r\nBrent writes: \r\n\r\nThis is also true for your phototropic robot. The transducers must be set up properly, so some causal properties somewhere in the light detection process, even if it is only the light itself, so that it steers the robot. \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nYou mangled this sentence a bit Brent (or so it seems to me), but I think that you are saying what I said above, and that the â€œevidence of interpretationâ€ is the behavior of the robot. The behavior is not the â€œseeing,â€ Iâ€™m sure you will argue, but it suggests that the representation has been â€œinterpreted.â€ No? But this does not answer my question. If all we have is receptors that â€œfireâ€ in ways systematically related to the light reflected  from the object, attached to  nerves that â€œfireâ€ in ways systematically related  to the firing of the receptors, and so on, all there is is more copying. Right? Yet suddenly, this copying becomes â€œinterpretation of the copy,â€ in a totally unexplained way. Further, the position seems to imply that behavior is somehow systematically related to the neural activity that immediately preceded it, in a way similar to the way the reflected light is related to the object from which it was reflected, i.e., related in the way we mean when we say it is a \"representation\") .  No? Its all just stuff that happens that is systematically related to the stuff that immediately follows and so on, at any step of which we can say of the systematicity that it is â€œrepresentation.â€  Isnâ€™t that what you meant when you said of the phototropic robot, â€œI think ALL this is representation, and not gratuitous at allâ€? And then you proceeded to talk about the causal chain leading from stimulus to response. But, as I said, the end of the chain, must somehow be related to the stimulus in the same way that any of the earlier representations were related to still earlier representations. So behavior is a â€œrepresentationâ€  of the stimulus? This seems to be nonsense. Plus, as I have been trying to point out, you want to say that it is ALL representation but, somehow, at some point, it is â€œinterpretation.â€ The position is reduced to gibberish by its own inconsistencies. \r\n\r\nBrent writes: \r\n\r\nAll these causal representations, including the ones that must be interpreted appropriately as ones and zeros, can be considered as abstract knowledge.

Sounds to me like you are saying that there is all this transfer of information from state to state (and that is ALL there is), each state having the relation to the previous state that could be described as â€œrepresentation,â€ all the way to behavior with respect to â€œwhat is seen,â€ and some place magic happens.\r\n\r\nBrent writes: \r\n\r\nYou say: \"The â€œmust beâ€ implies some sort of logical machinery behind the declaration, but I see none.\" and you always only focus on the resulting behavior. And to me, this is evidence that you don\'t yet fully understand what we are saying. \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nThen show precisely where I have demonstrated this misunderstanding. Seems to me that the â€œevidenceâ€ you have that I have misunderstood is that I am ridiculing the position.  \r\n\r\nBrent writes: \r\n\r\nWhen we use a digital camera that has an array of pixels that can be one (for red) or zero (for green) we can take a picture of the strawberry patch.

What I am pointing out is that it is internally-inconsistent and devoid of sense. Either â€œitâ€ is all â€œrepresentation,â€ as you said earlier, or there is â€œrepresentationâ€ and â€œinterpretation,â€ as you say immediately above. Which is it?  \r\n\r\n\r\nBrent writes: \r\n\r\nAlso, instead of digital memory, you could have some phenomenal brain matter or a neural correlate that had a red quale to be used to represent the strawberry, and neural correlate that had a green phenomenal property to represent the leaves.

But I think it sounds like gibberish, not because it is profound and difficult, but because it is devoid of sense. And it is devoid of sense because it embraces the mereological fallacy (i.e., some brain part â€œinterpretsâ€), and it is simply internally inconsistent. \r\n\r\nBrent writes: \r\n \r\nHave I converted you to our camp yet? ;) If not, I hope you get a camp started so I have a good concise reference that will help me better know just what it is you believe, and so I can know just how many people agree with you or like thinking of things in this way. \r\nBrent Allsop \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nAs I said, I have already â€œset-upâ€ a camp, but I expect no adherents. Most academicians are representationlists, as are most amateurs, because the camera metaphor is easily pushed. It is easy to forget that a photograph is a representation because it engenders some of the â€œeffectsâ€ of the thing that it is a photograph of. But this sort of representation (the photo) requires eyes, a brain, and ultimately a body for it to be â€œinterpreted.â€ But once you put the copy inside the brain, the metaphorical nature becomes clear. With what eyes do we see this inner representation, and to what brain are these eyes connected? But that is where I began my criticism, so I must be done for now.

If you support a camp, that implies that you agree with everything it says, and everything all parent camps say.\r\n\r\nThe best thing to do in such cases is to, in the particular camp forum, point out the things you disagree with, and indicate your willingness to join and support the camp, if such is moved to a lower level camp where you will not have to support it.  This is how the \"Representational Qualia Camp\" has formed.  My current camp is the \"Material Property Dualism\" camp (http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/7 ) and most of the stuff in that camp, and the other camps between it and the Representational Qualia Camp  were once all in the parent camp.  We are always motivated to get as many people as possible in the higher level camps, so we moved much of the stuff others disagreed with down into ever lower and less important camps, so they could join without having to support something they disagreed with.  We had to put quite a bit of collaborative effort to use neutral terminology that we could all agree with at those higher levels.\r\n\r\nI would think Meroe and Grey would be very open to any changes you might propose (including additions to the statement), since it would mean wining an obviously very motivated, intelligent and influential supporter to their camp.  Once they moved the disagreeable stuff to a lower level camp, you could change your camp\'s parent to be the improved and more agreeable version as a supporting camp instead of the current competitor position.\r\n\r\nYou questioned the purpose for voting.  Does that mean you have no value for knowing if there is a \'scientific consensus\' on various issues or not?  Say even something important like global warming?  So many people claim there is a scientific consensus amongst experts, yet there is lots of evidence that allows people to doubt such claims.  If we had a rigorous, quantitative, and definitive proof of how much consensus there was, nobody could doubt such.  I think knowing, definitively, who the experts are, and knowing quantitatively how much consensus there is amongst them is of critical importance to our ability to manage the ever more important moral and life threatening issues we face in the future as our power as humans continues to increase.\r\n\r\nI\'m reading all that you are saying, but have troubles fully understanding why you think some of this is so problematic, and why you think some things are so important, that I fail to see much value in.  We just obviously think of things very differently, and I think such diversity of thought is a very good thing - the more diversity the better.\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n','2010-05-30 16:57:17','2010-05-30 16:57:17'),(945,96,48,'Brent, Glen, \r\n\r\nHaving studied both your back and forth pro and con comments about behaviorism vs. representationalism (which incidentally, I essentially agree with)â€”I think you are both barking up trees and make little sense... Since all your arguments and counter arguments are specious and keep circling back on each other without any logical basis to qualify either position.\r\n\r\nSo, here are the facts (not assumptions), as I understand them from both a scientific and practical engineering viewpoint:\r\n\r\n1.  The totality of every reflection of light from any objects or group of objects is a representation of the image of the entire scene whose individual point sourced rays, at different frequencies (representing subtly different colors, tints, tones, shades, etc., reflected from every point on the object of perception) converge, as a complete hologram of that scene, on every zero-point of 3-space between the observer/perceiver and the objects of perception. Vide; Bohm-Pribramâ€™s \"holographic paradigm\" demonstrations and proofsâ€¦ One of which can be demonstrated experimentally by simply looking at the sky, observing the Milky Way, and realizing that each ray of light from every star converges at every zero-point on the surface of your observing eye lensâ€¦ Just as the same scene projected on the dome of a planetarium, travels there on rays of light originating from a single point source. \r\n\r\n2.  The observer, therefore, can subjectively see (visually experience) that total frequency modulated reflected image (from any selected viewpoint in 3-space) as a reconstructed holograph or complete pictureâ€”at the zero-point located at the exact center of the brain\'s EM field (in the pineal area) directly behind the eyes and between the ears.  \r\n\r\n[Incidentally, the perception of both vision and hearing must be at this stationary pointâ€”which besides allowing stereo binaural sound and binocular vision, also serves as a fixed reference to enable determination of the exact coordinate location of any point of visual or sound image origin, as well as also enabling coordination of those fields with the kinaesthetic body image field replicated in the brain as part of the kinaesthetic, neuromuscular, analog control systemâ€”guided by means of EM field harmonic resonances... This direct analog computational system (which cannot be accomplished by digital computers) is self evidentâ€”knowing that EM fields have no barriers anywhere within or surrounding the human body, and that all fields originating from any zero-point within the body, holonomically interpenetrate each other.]\r\n\r\n3.  The brain, then, can only function, simply, as the intermediate electrochemical transponder/transformer that assembles and converts the image pixels, received from each rod and cone on the retinas, to a wave interference patterned hologram in the brain-wave fieldâ€”carried on its radiant surfaces similarly to the way audio-video images are temporarily stored and transmitted through radio wave fields, received at individual stationary antenna, detected point by point and transformed/transmitted to individual pixel points on a screen and to individual point source loudspeakersâ€”whose radiant energy fields are representational replicas of the original fields reflected or projected from their initial objective sources.\r\n\r\n4.  As an obvious conclusion from the above facts, it is also self evident that the mind and the memory are electromagnetic fields, along with their resonant higher frequency-energy fractal harmonic fields that reach down to the Plank volume and its ZPE fields surrounding every zero point of consciousness.  \r\n\r\nSo, obviously, all theories that claim representationalism or behaviorism that assume consciousness (awareness-will, qualia, etc.) is an epiphenomena of the brain\'s neurology, a quantum effect, such as \"wave collapse\", an electrochemical process, or the behavioral nature of any material object or fieldâ€”is entirely mistaken... \r\n\r\nThis, apparently eliminates most, if not all the camps and sub camps in the consciousness-mind canonized topic that do not consider those subjective functions of observer/responder consciousness as fundamental aspects of the absolute singularity at the origin of total multidimensional spacetime reality, as well as each field and form within it...  With such consciousness being passively latent in all inorganic matter, and phenomenally expressive in all organic sentient beingsâ€”at varying degrees depending on their neural complexityâ€¦ And, with such media mind-memory information being separate entities from the brainâ€™s physical structures and neural-electrochemistryâ€”as independent mutually resonant (coenergetic) harmonics of the brainâ€™s inherent and neural-generated electromagnetic fields.\r\n\r\nI hope this short description of actual subjective and objective realityâ€”which doesnâ€™t violate any of the fundamental laws of quantum, relativity, or superstring physicsâ€”clears the air, and can add some truth to all the arguments flying around here that seem to contradict each other at every turnâ€¦ None of which offers any logical or scientifically reasonable solution to the consciousness-mind problems.\r\n\r\nLeon Maurer\r\n\r\nhttp://canonizer.com/topic.asp/23/17\r\n\r\nhttp://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/4','2010-05-31 04:18:53','2010-05-31 04:18:53'),(946,1,33,'Camp Statement: Subjective experience, language, and consciousness can be completely explained in terms of abilities we share with the simplest of creatures,â€¦ \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nI completely agree.

To this day there are not that many people who are familiar with the sort of careful conceptual analysis of the notions â€œstimulusâ€ and â€œresponseâ€ that was put forth in Skinnerâ€™s â€œThe Generic Nature of the Concepts of Stimulus and Response.â€ In any event, the unconditioned elicited response is a functionally-defined, analytical unit that is a (but not â€œtheâ€) starting point for the analysis of â€œlearningâ€ and, thus, a starting point for the analysis of the sorts of behavioral observations that have traditionally been discussed in terms of an alleged â€œmind.â€œ The term â€œassociateâ€ and the notion of associationism date at least from Aristotle, but it was, of course, Pavlov that began the systematic exploration of the effects of arranging certain kinds of relationships among stimuli. The analysis of classical conditioning is now quite complex and sophisticated and, as with the very definition of  unconditioned elicited behavior,  is not well understood by the general public or even by most professionals who are, in one way or another, concerned with the sorts of behavior said to require a â€œmind.â€ Although many who study Pavlovian conditioning have jumped on the cognitive â€œscienceâ€ bandwagon, the alleged cognitive processes allegedly going on are largely superfluous to an analysis that forgoes, for the time being, any attempt at mediationism in order to pursue, directly, relations between experimental arrangements and their behavioral effects. That strategy is, of course, the foundation of the experimental analysis of behavior, nowadays simply referred to as â€œbehavior analysis.â€ In addition to elicited behavior, there is another kind of behavior that is not closely tied (at least at first) to some antecedent stimulus. Such behavior occurs spontaneously (from a behavioral-level standpoint) and is often modifiable by its consequences*. Such behavior is called â€œoperantâ€ behavior a term coined by B.F. Skinner, who founded behavior analysis and the philosophy called â€œradical behaviorism.â€ The fundamental analytical unit of operant behavior is the â€œoperantâ€ or â€œoperant response class.â€ An operant response class is, like conditioned and unconditioned elicited responses, functionally defined. Whereas elicited behavior is a functionally-defined correlation between a class of stimuli and a class of responses whose occurrence depends on the presentation of the stimuli, an operant is defined, for starters anyway, in terms of all responses that have a particular effect on the environment. In the laboratory, the consequence that defines an operant is generally the closure of a switch mounted on a lever or behind a piece of Plexiglas (i.e., a â€œpigeon keyâ€), and a response is defined as any thing the animal does that closes the switch. Certain sorts of events (food-delivery, for example) can then be made contingent on these responses, and if the arrangement of such contingencies causes an increase in the frequency of occurrence of members of the response class, the event is called a â€œreinforcer.â€ When these two-term contingencies are made to function only in the presence of a particular stimulus, and not in its absence, the stimulus exerts control, in conjunction with other variables, over the probability of the response. This is referred to as â€œstimulus controlâ€ and the stimulus a â€œdiscriminative stimulus.â€ \r\n\r\nI have been somewhat long-winded above for a reason; to the extent that â€œdetection,â€ â€œreaction,â€ and â€œassociationâ€ have some overlap with the basic notions that characterize behavior analysis, then, to some extent, one set of terminology is redundant and fails to direct a listenerâ€™s attention to the relevant data. I would hold that â€œdetection,â€ etc. are not only redundant, they also lack the sort of sophisticated conceptual analysis that surrounds the terms employed by behavior analysis, an undeniably successful natural science of behavior. Finally, before I turn to other aspects of the camp statement, I would say that, contrary to popular belief, the theoretical speculations of Skinner and others are quite cogent; the only people that think, for example, that Chomskyâ€™s â€œreviewâ€ of Skinnerâ€™s â€œVerbal Behaviorâ€ was LEGITIMATELY devastating (for there is no doubt that it was enormously influential) are those that have not read the book (as Chomsky did not!). \r\n\r\n\r\n*Ultimately, I would argue that behavior should be classified by its locus in a two dimensional space where the axes are â€œelicitabilityâ€ and â€œmodifiability.â€ \r\n \r\nCamp Statement: With these three innate abilities, an organism can begin to form de facto categories (some things are food or a mate; some aren\'t), develop expectations, and learn. We can see such capabilities in numerous other animals, but there is no need to assume at this point that they have any self-awareness or are anything more than a contiguous collection of chemical reactions, which happen, by evolutionary \'selection\', to all work in a coordinated way to further \'their\' collective survival. Thoughts are not yet \'about,\' or \'directed toward,\' anything. Intentionality is an interpretation in the eye of an observer and without language there isn\'t one. Communication learning, associations of certain sounds with certain DRA experiences, is seen in several animal species. Human language is different in degree but not kind. A language is not shared words/syntax, it is shared or, rather, convergent, experiences which are associated with those words/syntax and which give them their meaning. Just as a vervet monkey learns what to do and emit when it detects an eagle as opposed to a snake, a child learns which detections (hunger, color) to associate with the sounds such as \'I am hungry\' or \'I see red.\' As previous linguistic associations are applied to new experiences, children are capable of uttering intelligible phrases which they may have never heard before. An organism\'s subjective experience is also explained in terms of detection, reaction, association, and language. Consciousness--the information that an entity or monad can process about itself and the world--is a continuum with bacteria (or chemical reactions like rust) at one end and human self-awareness at the other. \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nThere is much to be praised in the above. However, like the terminology resulting in the acronym DRA, it seems to be a somewhat preliminary discussion of topics that have been written about  for more than a century, and have been systematized during the more than 70 year history of behavior analysis. Indeed, to some extent, it seems like an attempt to treat behavioral phenomena from the same perspective as behavior analysis but to shun its sophisticated concepts and rich empirical data base. Surely the author(s) of this camp statement must be aware, at some level, of behavior analysis. [And, incidentally, you can see much of its history of research, as well as theoretical and conceptual issues, here: http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jeab/   ]. That is most puzzling to me. Having said all that, however, I must say that much of what is said in the camp statement seems naÃ¯ve, hasty, and needlessly idiosyncratic (i.e., â€œmonads,â€ really?). Further, I would ask the adherents of this position to consider the brilliant theoretical and conceptual analyzes offered by Skinner concerning verbal response classes and, in particular, the relation of these analyzes to the topic of â€œself-awareness.â€ The behavior of humans is certainly understandable as a continuous with other organisms, but there is much that, in humans, achieves a level of complexity that is unmatched by other organisms. In particular, much of the so-called â€œcommunicationâ€ among non-humans has little relevance to human verbal behavior. In most non-humans, â€œcommunicationâ€ involves elicited behavior that functions as eliciting stimuli in conspecifics.  Human verbal behavior can be viewed as operant behavior in which the reinforcer is mediated through the actions of listeners, and this is the starting point of Skinnerâ€™s â€œVerbal Behavior.â€ Self-awareness, then, is viewed as arising when a verbal community arranges contingencies that bring our verbal behavior under stimulus control of other aspects of our behavior. So, differences in â€œhuman languageâ€ and the â€œcommunication systemsâ€ of other species are, in fact different in kind, although operant behavior is present in all birds, mammals, bony fishes, and some reptiles, as well as some invertebrates**. Further, â€œself-awarenessâ€ does not follow from species membership, or so the argument goes. Its emergence depends on the arrangement of contingencies that â€œforceâ€ that awareness; it happens when our own behavior becomes discriminative stimuli for verbal responses. \r\n\r\nFinally, I am not naÃ¯ve, and I do not think that this little piece can convince the (two?) members of this camp to abandon the concepts of DRA but, admittedly, that is an ultimate goal. However, I think that the initial sentence of the camp statement is something that I agree with; the aspects of behavior said to require a mind is built out of behavioral processes that humans have in common with many organisms. What if that was the basis of the camp statement, but the particulars of what those behavioral processes are take a lower level? That would not be the most satisfying to me, however, and as I suggested, â€œdetection and reactionâ€ are simply subsumed by the notion of unconditioned elicited responses. Anyway, there is much more that I could say, but I have been too long-winded already.\r\n\r\nCordially,\r\nGlen\r\n\r\n** This is not to say that it is necessarily present in all vertebrates - Iâ€™m not sure that there are convincing evidence for operant conditioning in amphibians.','2010-05-31 14:18:49','2010-05-31 14:18:49'),(947,1,33,'Glen,\r\n\r\nYou put me in mind of the dinner guest who barges in and quickly swallows only a few hors d\' oeuvres before summarily storming out, rudely and loudly complaining that the promised meal was not filling and, in any case, heâ€™d eaten something somewhat similar at another dinner occasion and wondered why this meal had a different name and wasnâ€™t exactly like the first.  \r\n\r\n>>I must say that much of what is said in the camp statement seems >>naÃ¯ve, hasty, and needlessly idiosyncraticâ€¦ \r\n\r\nGlen, it is a paragraph, a camp statement.

Now, youâ€™ve obviously put some thought into your response and I do appreciate that, but I wish that you had taken the time to read the longer explanations of the theory in A Brief Explanation (7-pages), or my original (160-page) work, From Dust to Descartes which would have answered many of your assumptions.  Needless to say I do not have the time to present the ideas of a 160-page work here or in a simple camp statement.  I would have expected someone of your obvious intelligence to understand this and seek additional information before lighting fires.  Nevertheless, I will attempt to briefly address some of your points here in the interest of the seriousness of your response.\r\n\r\n>>Why invent this new terminology of â€œdetectionâ€ and\r\n>>â€œreaction,â€ when there is an existing science with which you could\r\nmake contact?\r\n\r\nLet me start by explaining why the terms Detection, Reaction, and Association are used and not some of the other terms used in the discipline.  \r\n\r\nI had several objectives when I started working on From Dust to Descartes.\r\n1.	I wanted to start from first principles.  Sometimes when you have been banging your head for a few centuries on an intractable problem, it is helpful to start from zero.  I wanted to start assuming nothing more than a world of consistent â€œIf X then Yâ€ reactions and see how far I could get without assuming anything else. \r\n2.	I also wanted an argument that was accessible to the lay person and that used nothing more than the received wisdom of current science and philosophy.  Not only do I think that the subject is so important that every one should be able to understand it, but I also didnâ€™t think that evolution had made any big, complicated jumps.  If we just started from simple reactions and went slowly and methodically enough we should be able to eventually get to self-awareness.  I believe that DRA does this and nothing in your comments, which hardly touch on the theoryâ€™s merits, suggests otherwise.  Furthermore, I felt that it should be easier to debate and discuss these issues using terms and experiences that were more accessible.  \r\n\r\nThe word â€œDetectionâ€ was chosen as a way of analogizing between those chemical (if â€¦ thenâ€¦) reactions and sensation without the reader immediately rejecting the analogy because of all of the assumptions of subjective experience than usually go along with the word â€œsensation.â€  So I wouldnâ€™t have used a term like â€œunconditioned elicited responsesâ€ because 1) I was starting from more basic first principles 2) and I also wanted it grounded in simple chemical reactions.  I was not trying to explain consciousness in terms of Pavlovian conditioning or the simple behavioral responses of other creatures (although the first sentence of the camp statement may imply that). I was really trying to explain consciousness in terms of simple chemical reactions.   The word â€œDetectionâ€ I think offered a way to do that.  â€œReactionâ€ was another way of analogizing to the emotions from simple chemical reactions but, again, without the implications of subjective experience.  The same with â€œAssociationâ€ â€“ a way of suggesting memory in a mechanical way without the baggage of subjective experience before I was ready to explain it.  As I worked through From Dust to Descartes, I wanted to be able to introduce the concepts of sensation, emotion, and memory without the reader getting caught up on subjective experience which I intended to address later.   I will readily agree that there may be better terms that could have been chosen , but my intention was to get people would focus on the arguments more than on what these things are called.  In your case, at lease, I appear to have failed but I can say unequivocally that starting from Skinner or any one elseâ€™s analysis with terms like â€œunconditioned elicited responsesâ€ would not have met either of my original objectives.\r\n\r\n>>it seems to be a somewhat preliminary\r\n>>discussion of topics that have been written about for more than a\r\n>>century, and have been systematized during the more than 70 year\r\n>>history of behavior analysis.\r\n\r\nGlen, you have read a paragraph summary of a 160-page paper.  I should hope that all of your analysis is not so conclusory.  As I state in Dust to Descartes, all of the ideas presented can find their seconds (or better said their â€œfirstsâ€) in other theorists (I have hundreds of citations).  This is a strength not a weakness of the theory.

But after reading, at least much of, your 7-page explanation, and examining parts of your 160 page work, I would stand by much of what I said.  And I have my own reasons to be angry. It is considered poor scholarship to miss too much of the literature, especially if oneâ€™s paper is large. But this does not hold for the literature in behavior analysis or behaviorism.  Ignoring this literature is not noticed - it is part of the institutionalized misrepresentation and  de facto censorship by most of the â€œintellectual community.â€ That is a windmill with which I sometimes do battle.  \r\n\r\nMeroe (at first quoting me):\r\n\r\n>>Why invent this new terminology of â€œdetectionâ€ and >>â€œreaction,â€ when there is an existing science with which you could make contact? \r\n\r\nLet me start by explaining why the terms Detection, Reaction, and Association are used and not some of the other terms used in the discipline. \r\nI had several objectives when I started working on From Dust to Descartes. 1.

What if there were a science that could manage many of these issues, but for some historical reason it was misrepresented and ignored.

But I guess what you are saying is that your â€œfirst principleâ€ is more basic because it simply starts with if-then (causation) and not â€œif stimulus X - response y. But, nonetheless, the first place you go is basically to elicited responses, at least as far as I can tell. Further, I guess that your use of â€œchemical reactionsâ€ is meant to keep the illusion that you are starting from â€œfirst principleâ€ of a physico-chemical nature. However, it is clear that what would be manipulated and measured, were you to manipulate and measure anything would be stimuli and responses.\r\n\r\nMeroe: \r\n\r\nI was not trying to explain consciousness in terms of Pavlovian conditioning or the simple behavioral responses of other creatures (although the first sentence of the camp statement may imply that). \r\n\r\nGlen quips:\r\n\r\nErrrâ€¦ummâ€¦yeah.

At least in ways that â€œdetectionâ€ and â€œreactionâ€ do not? In fact, it seems to me that â€œdetectionâ€ encourages â€œsubjectivityâ€ more than â€œeliciting stimulus,â€ for â€œdetectionâ€ implies some pre-behavioral phenomenon that leads to â€œreaction.â€ The stimulus does not produce a response (or a â€œreactionâ€), it first produces â€œdetectionâ€ and that somehow leads to â€œreaction.â€ \r\n\r\nMeroe: \r\n\r\nThe same with â€œAssociationâ€ â€“ a way of suggesting memory in a mechanical way without the baggage of subjective experience before I was ready to explain it.

And as far as â€œassociationâ€ goes, you point to the role of temporal contiguity in Pavlovian conditioning! \r\n\r\nMeroe (at first quoting me):\r\n\r\n>>it seems to be a somewhat preliminary >>discussion of topics that have been written about for more than a >>century, and have been systematized during the more than 70 year >>history of behavior analysis. \r\n\r\nGlen, you have read a paragraph summary of a 160-page paper.

There have been a few rebuttals to Chomskyâ€™s â€œreview.â€ Have you read them? I didnâ€™t think so. And it is odd that you cite Chomsky since your opening sentence implies that â€œhuman languageâ€ is understandable in terms of processes shared with other species, a position that Chomsky would certainly not agree with. But, above, you disavow that verbiage, so Iâ€™m not sure where that leaves your argument.  \r\n\r\nMeroe: \r\n\r\nGlen, I am more than willing to continue this discussion.

You appear to be more interested in the â€œcorrectnessâ€ of your view than you are in how the world works. The most prominent position that holds that the behavioral observations said to require â€œmindâ€ are best explained by basic processes shared by many species is radical behaviorism, bolstered by the natural science called behavior analysis. I am guessing you are ignorant of these, and wish to remain so.  \r\n\r\n','2010-06-01 20:18:43','2010-06-01 20:18:43'),(951,96,48,'[Brent]\r\n \r\nSince you referred to these two theories, using their proposed names, it sounds like you agree that these are good names for these theories, even though you think they are \'barking up the wrong tree\'? In other words, do you plan on using these two names to refer to the way David Chalmers, et al, and myself think about consciousness in these two competing ways?\r\n\r\n[Lenny]\r\n\r\nNo.  Because, I donâ€™t think that those names have any descriptive meaning, or refer to anything more than a guess about how consciousness works in conjunction with matter... Or, that they actually describe the way you or Chalmers, et al think about the true cause and nature of consciousness and its relationship to mind, memory, brain, body, senses, etc.\r\n\r\nAs far as my own viewsâ€¦ There is no overall dualismâ€”since the entire cosmos and its physical universe, along with its ubiquitous consciousness, is one unified thing in essence (like a particle is actually a standing wave form)â€¦ Yet, it\'s also perfectly obvious to me, that there are infinite dualisms in natureâ€”which are simply oppositesâ€”such as the dualisms of subjectivity and objectivity; consciousness and matter, attraction and repulsion; positive and negative, up and down, in and out, day and night, emptiness and fullness, beginning and end, absolute and relative, involution and evolution, etc., etc., etc.  All of which simply tells me that the entire cosmos is rooted in cyclic law, and that everything in our universe is subject to periodic change... Just as they are also subject to linear motion (vs. non linear motion, or static position) in both time and space.  All my scientific thinking is based on those fundamental principles and the apparent contradictions they incur.\r\n\r\n[Brent] \r\n\r\nAlso, your argument or asking: \"how separate physical substances could express each of those millions if not billions of subtly different color frequencies in the brain\'s neural system?\" is not at all convincing to me. It is well documented that the human mind has a very limited ability to distinguish between colors. A very simple camera can easily represent far more colors than we can distinguish. Certainly there are far more total diverse types of chemical compounds, gazilions of different types of protean chains alone, than in a simple camera, and so on. Certainly The total number of distinguishable colors could easily be mapped to a very insignificantly small subset of all of this in a gazillion different ways?\r\n\r\n[Lenny\r\n\r\nWhere is that â€œwell documentedâ€ evidence proving that â€œthe human mind has a very limited ability to distinguish between colorsâ€?   \r\n\r\nAs far as I knowâ€”from my many years of experience as a fine artist and expert colorist and special effects motion picture producer (as far advanced as the most highly developed computer animation and special effects movie making systems today)â€”the human eye is sensitive to, and the mind can store, distinguish and compensate for far more subtle colors, tints, shades, contrasts, etc. than any camera (analog or digital) can record (since much of color vision is psychological adaptation)â€¦  \r\n\r\nTherefore, its perfectly obvious to me that the conscious mindâ€”coupled resonantly through the harmonics of the radiant EM fields generated by the electrochemistry of the brainâ€™s neurologyâ€”can store near infinite amounts of frequency modulated visual information (not limited only by the physical light frequency spectrum) that can be, instantaneously, directly transmitted (by simple phase conjugate adaptive resonance processes) down through the highest order harmonic fields in the Planck volumeâ€”to the single point of observer awareness in the center of our head.  (I would need another few paragraphs to prove that such a geocentric conscious reference point is absolutely necessary for survival of any sentient being, and at least several pages to logically prove why such intermediate higher order harmonic fields of mind and memory must exist between the brain and that zero-point of visual consciousness.)\r\n\r\nThus, our discerning and discriminating consciousness can easily distinguish the difference between the finest frequency modulations (in the range of the visible light detected by the retinas), and can exactly determine the subtlest color, tint, or shade of any single pixel point in the overall image perceived (whose resolution is limited to the number of rods and cones in the eye retinas plus all the spaces between them).  And, itâ€™s also a demonstrable fact that our consciousness can also invent its own color, tint or shade (in the lowest frequency working mind field) to compensate for any inconsistencies in the image that is not consistent with the memory (stored in the longer term, higher frequency fields) of similar scenes observed in the past.  In fact, the consciousness itself can also create and experience colors that are not even thereâ€”as has been demonstrated numerous times by printed or animated optical illusions. (Which most scientists seem to think are neurological functions, since all they can measure is the feedback resonance of the brain wave field transferred back to the neurochemistry, whose secondary effects, only, can be seen in an fMRI image).  This shows how science is constantly misled by their indirect observations and materialist biases and presumptions.  Very few of them understand how the mind unconsciously, due to its subjectively (subliminal awareness/will) controlled variable oscillation frequency, psychologically fills in the gaps between the individual frames of a motion picture in order to experience it as continuous linear motion.\r\n \r\nSo, I canâ€™t wait to hear the logical technical explanation (such as any engineer would need to replicate it) of how the brain alone can accomplish all that by some equally simple and direct physical-chemical process?   \r\n\r\nWhere is the empirical evidence that the brain can map a distinctive color frequency modulation to a particular protein?  And, how does that explain the process whereby that protein creates the conscious experience or qualia that allows our center of individual visual awareness to distinguish it from any other similarly â€œcolored proteinâ€?  As far as I know, seeing is a psychological process, not a physical one. \r\n\r\nSo, far, all your assumptions (I wouldnâ€™t call it a theory) has done is initiate another infinite regress or impossible condition to describe brain processes, that completely bypasses the real problems of explaining consciousness and mind... Such as: What, where and who is our individual consciousness? What is the nature of the cause of our experiences?  What is awareness and will?  Where and from what do they originate?  What is the power of the will based on?  What is the mind made of?   How does the mind connect to the brain?  I could go on an on with many such unanswered questions. So far, all weâ€™ve gotten is a series of assumptions and blind beliefs, along with much gibberish, much like blowing in the windâ€”that have no rational basis or logical ground to stand on.\r\n\r\nMethinks, that anyone who believes that god or nature would chose such a complex chicken before the egg process to fill the gap between consciousness and matter, when the whole of existence in this cosmos is based (from its primal beginning up until the smallest particles evolve into the largest galaxies of the physical universe) on radiant energy fields. Nothing in the physical universe could exist without those intermediate, information carrying spacetime fields (along with their harmonics and ZPE sources)â€”as their fundamental roots.   QED.\r\n\r\n[Brent]\r\n\r\nHow about the idea of effing the ineffable, in particular? Do you think we will ever be able to know, effingly, what someone else represents 700nm light with, and how it compares to what we represent it with - ever - in any way - even if only theoretically? Can we at least agree on this as a possibility?\r\n\r\n[Lenny]\r\n\r\nIf your coined word â€œeffingâ€â€™s non slang meaning is (as the opposite of â€œineffableâ€) being able to explain something in wordsâ€¦ Then I donâ€™t think we can ever know, through words alone, how anyone experiences the frequency of a particular color, tint or shade (which can only be represented as a modulation of an electromagnetic field).   However, since the electromagnetic field of the brain and the mechanisms of detecting, producing, processing and carrying a modulated image in it, is the same for all human beings of equivalent healthâ€¦ The simplest way to know (without explaining in words) of how a 700nm wavelength is experienced by someone elseâ€”is to look at a color of that same reflected wavelength and subjectively experience it personally.  Remembering, however, that if their physical functions, past experiences and psychological natures are different than yours, they will see the color differently, in accord with their own natures.\r\n\r\nHowever, since it would also look different in different backgrounds, on different object textures, angles of view, incident lighting, etc â€“ you would have to make certain that you are both looking at that colored object in the exact same scene and background, with the same exact lighting conditions, that your eye lenses have the same clarity and focus, that neither of you have any defective retinas (color blindness, etc.) and that you both have the same level of health of the brainâ€™s visual cortex.  Naturally, any difference in physical condition anywhere along the path of electrochemical processing of the signal will result in a different experience of the color.  E.g.; Since I have a cataract in one eye and a clear lens in the other, I can easily see the slight difference in overall color frequencies processed through each of the eyes (with the cataract eye shifting all colors toward the yellow end of the spectrum). \r\n\r\nSo, it is very questionable if any of us can actually know the exact color anyone else experiences, even though we all receive the same color frequencies at the surface of their eyes. The differences could be as subtle or as much as the differences between our individual fingerprints.  \r\n\r\nAll that, of course, along with other observational and mind experiments, firmly convinces me that the brain has nothing to do with the actual experience of consciousness, other thanâ€”if damaged, or structurally different anywhere along the perceptive pathâ€”modifying the frequencies carried by the inner astral light field experienced reflectively at our single point of visual consciousness in the center of our headâ€”which is entangled with the eternal self conscious center of our soul (monadic field) located in our naval plexus. \r\n\r\nIn any event, this analog electromagnetic process of image perception works the same way for everyoneâ€”even though there may be many functional differences along the path between the sensory receptors and the conscious perceiver (Incidentally, the process by which this point of visual consciousness detects, holographically reconstructs, and perceives the hologram image in the mind-memory fields, by coherent radiation and reflection, is thoroughly explained on my blogs and in my canonizer camp.)\r\n\r\nSo, if you are not convinced now that pure perceptive/responsive consciousness (awareness, will, qualia, etc) is fundamental and totally separate from, yet dependent on the mass-energies that compose the mind-memory fields, brain, body, senses, and every cell composing all sentient beings in both the vegetable and animal kingdoms of natureâ€¦ It would appear that you are so conditioned by your lifelong religious beliefs in materialism and a personal God, as both the creator and savior, coupled with a possibly inbred or conditioned antipathy of any contradictory heresies... That it may either take another lifetime, an irrefutable scientific proof, or a sudden intuitive leap of direct transcendental revelation to change your present mindset, and convince you otherwise.\r\n\r\nAs for my own thesis regarding the origin of consciousness, mind and matter, and their roots in pre cosmic absolute space, along with explaining the way consciousness actually worksâ€¦ Since all of it is fully outlined and illustrated in my canonizer camps and argued on the web sites belowâ€”I would appreciate any serious comments or logical scientifically proven, point by point refutations.  IOW, if you or anyone else can show me convincing mind or direct experimental evidence, or any other logical scientific alternative that would contradict this fundamental view of total reality, I will be happy to change or modify my thesis wherever necessary.\r\n\r\nSo far, after more than 30 years of waitingâ€”I am sticking with my guns...

We all have many demands on our time and attention, and I appreciate the good faith effort you apparently made to try to understand a bit better where I was coming from. \r\n\r\nI do not have much time but Iâ€™ll try to give you some response.   Please forgive any typos.\r\n\r\n>>>I doubt that any further communication could be fruitful. You appear to be more interested in the â€œcorrectnessâ€ of your view than you are in how the world works.\r\n\r\nIf you go back and look you will see that at no point, in my response to you did I defend the conclusions of my paper. I have not yet had a chance to (or for that matter, a need to, since you have not attacked the â€œcorrectnessâ€ of my views as much as you have questioned the terminology.)  I simply explained in my response that you were working under misunderstandings about what the paper was about and what it was attempting to do. Unfortunately, as you can see below, you still are:\r\n\r\n>>> And it is odd that you cite Chomsky since your opening sentence implies that â€œhuman languageâ€ is understandable in terms of processes shared with other species, a position that Chomsky would certainly not agree with.\r\n\r\nI do not \"cite\" Chomsky, at least not in agreement. As I said in my previous comment, I â€œaddressâ€ his arguments. I disagree with both his hasty critique of behaviorism and his ideas on language. By pointing you to the exact pages on which you could find my views of communication and Chomsky\'s critique, I\'d hoped to avoid another such misunderstanding but alas... \r\n\r\nPlease stop pushing against an open door. I am not your intellectual â€œenemyâ€. I actually agree that some of behaviorism\'s insights were too hastily abandoned. It\'s as if after a few (admittedly very clever) critiques everyone threw up their hands in intellectual surrender and ran away from behaviorism as fast as they could. Yet, having said that, this doesn\'t mean that I think we must defend behaviorism exactly as it was or even necessarily begin our analysis from its conclusions.\r\n\r\n>>What if the problem is not as intractable as it seems? What if there were a science that could manage many of these issues, but for some\r\nhistorical reason it was misrepresented and ignored.

I should say though that my objective is not to analyze, measure, or manipulate behavior (for which Skinnerâ€™s terminology might, as you suggest, be useful) as much as it is to explain why we are aware of our behavior.\r\n\r\n>>>Yet there appears little substantive difference between your\r\nterminology and the language of unconditioned elicitation. And as far\r\nas â€œassociationâ€ goes, you point to the role of temporal contiguity\r\nin Pavlovian conditioning!\r\n\r\nSo letâ€™s get past arguments over terminology and labeling and begin a discussion about the subjective experience of emotion, the experience of color, language, intentionality, self-awareness, reflection, and metacognitionâ€¦  Letâ€™s talk about the structure of an explanation of consciousness and we can argue over what color to paint the structure later.\r\n\r\nAs I said in my original email, I would love to finally be able to begin to address with you the merits of the arguments themselves. (There is no need to read the longer 160 page work, the shorter paper is a more than sufficient basis for beginning a discussion.) If at the end, of that good faith discussion we can come to an agreement on the structure of an explanation of consciousness but then realize that the same conclusion has been reached before or could be better explained with other terminology then so be it. At least we would have successfully restored a forgotten treasure.

Or is it a problem posed by straw men? Seeing (or hearing etc.) for both behaviorists and â€œembodied cognitivistsâ€ (at least the ones that I have read) is behavior, and behavior is elicited or engendered by stimuli and it is (sometimes) altered by its consequences, but behavior is not the antecedent stimulus, nor is it somehow structurally related to it.  The point here is that there is absolutely nothing troublesome to the â€œdirect perceptionâ€ people, that I know, that what we report when we engage in the behavior called seeing is at odds with what we might say when we have intercourse with the stimuli in some other fashion. There is nothing particularly troubling when, after looking at (which is behavior) the stimuli that constitute the Muller-Lyer illusion we say â€œThe one on the left is larger.â€œ but when we lay a ruler against the lines we say â€œThey are both the same size!â€œ Think about this for a while, Brent. Ten or twenty years should be sufficient. \r\n\r\nBut I do admit that it (i.e. the Moon Illusion) is a bigger problem for behaviorism than representationalism because behaviorism is â€œhamstrungâ€ by the pesky notion that explanations and theories should not consist of nonsense. I have already shown why â€œseeing a representationâ€ (except in the literal sense of looking at a photograph etc.) is nonsense. The standard representationalist argument for illusions like the Moon illusion is that if we â€œsee the Moon as largeâ€ it is because the representation (that we â€œreally seeâ€) contains a large Moon. And why is it large? Why because the representation is an inference that the brain makes about â€œwhat is out there.â€ More nonsense heaped on the top of nonsense.  \r\n\r\nBrent writes:\r\n\r\nIn other words, all representationalists that I know of consider such problems to completely obviously demonstrably falsify any such theories. \r\n\r\nGlen responds:\r\n\r\nYou mean all representationalists whose initials are SL?

And that is because they are not interested in actually understanding the alternative view - you know, the view that is not riddled with nonsense? But I have been, I admit, up until now from your standpoint, cryptic. I have not really said how I explain the Moon Illusion. But you are not ready for that explanationâ€¦.letâ€™s pick something easier. Say I present some shapes of different colors to subjects very briefly. One of the shapes is a â€œvalentine.â€ You know, â€œheart-shapedâ€ in the card-playing sense. Say I present (remember briefly) this shape and it is literally non-reflective (black; so it would have to be presented on some background) . In any event, if I present the stimulus briefly enough, and ask the subjects what color it was, what do you think they will say? Chances are, or so Skinner claimed (but I think there was an actual experiment done that he was referring to, but I have been unable to track it down), that the subject will say that the stimulus was â€œredâ€ (even though it was black) or, as Skinner claimed, sometimes â€œpurple.â€  Why might that be? If we â€œfamiliarizedâ€ a member of a â€œnon-card-playing cultureâ€ (i.e., a â€œprimitiveâ€ culture), with the apparatus, would such subjects proclaim the black heart to be red? No. Why? Why would they not? Hereâ€™s the point: the representationalist would claim that the card-playing subjectsâ€™ brains made an inference about the stimuli that the non-card-playing subjects did not.  The card-playing subjects, then, saw a red representation (as evidenced by the fact that they said â€œredâ€œ) , where the non-card-playing subjects â€œcorrectlyâ€ identified the stimulus as â€œblack.â€ Hereâ€™s the point: the card -playing subjects are likely to identify the â€œheartâ€ stimulus as â€œred,â€ whereas it is clear that the average â€œbushmanâ€ will not.  Bottom line:  the card playing dude has a history where â€œvalentineâ€  shapes are paired with â€œred,â€ and when a black heart is presented, the card player dude says â€œred.â€ But other humans, without exposure to the same history, do not see the stimulus â€œas red.â€  \r\n\r\nPerception is a function of history [Just like behavior!].

However, it postulates that human zero-point consciousness is separate and independent of brain, body, senses, etc., and is the awareness of individual self as well as the sole perceiver, discerner, discriminator, thinker, chooser, decider, actor, etc.   And that the shortest term mind and short and long term memory are separate fields that carry both the immediate perceived sensory image information and the past learned, species, archetypal, or total knowledge information.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, the moon illusionâ€”like all illusions that require comparison between the image perceived in the mind with the simultaneously recalled memory of past images recorded in long term memoryâ€”is simply a subjective decision of conscious awareness to compensate for perspective differences or size and color relationships between different objects in the immediate field of view and learned perspectives and object sizes and colors in past viewed images.\r\n\r\nSince the remembered images compared are in the fields of mind-memory, rather than in the present outside world, the conscious choice of the experience of qualia could be considered as both representational and causatively behavioral.  Obviously, the wakeful conscious or unconscious perceiver, as the chooser of the illusion, is also the willful or intentional source of the behavioral response to the selected qualia perceived.  \r\n\r\nNow, I ask Glen; How can behavioral psychology explain the Moon illusion without resorting to a visual representation of the image of perception in the mind between the conscious perceiver and the object of perception?\r\n','2010-06-06 04:04:16','2010-06-06 04:04:16'),(966,35,47,'Hi Richard,\r\n\r\na substantive quibble sounds oxymoronic but much of life is like that I think; so much depends on context and view point.\r\n\r\nMy reasons for asserting the \"updating\" as central:\r\n\r\n* awareness is a process or [suite or \'cloud\' of] processes involving real changes. This is shown by the fact that if the process of perception is constrained, eg by holding the eye still, or holding the sensing body part still, or holding the attention on one object, the perception stops and the object/subject in focus slips out of awareness. Something similar happens when the stilling of focus is purely internal. \r\n[Why this happens, could occupy us for half a lifetime, so ignore it for now] \r\n\r\n* the \"self\" is not definable except in contrast to and relationship with \"not-self\" so both, as concepts and practical reality, are moving targets [or movable feasts to a more optimistic mind set]; the world does not stand still and neither do people - with trivial exceptions noted of course - so change and dealing with novelty is most of what it is all about\r\n\r\n* the corollary of this, it seems to me, is that the activity of the brain is aimed at assimilating that which is dependable and predictable - the invariances as many people call them - so that deviations from the norm can be dealt with as quickly and effectively as possible.

There is no good reason for ignoring the obvious inference that wave motion measured by EEG is more than an epiphenomenon like the waves made by wind on a wheat field. \r\n\r\nIt makes far more sense to see that EM oscillations resulting from coincident firing of crowds of neurons must have a driving and constraining effect on the neurons of the crowd.

Generally speaking though the clinicians and and researchers using MRI and other imaging techniques are always working towards their holy grail and, in my opinion, they seem to be getting some very interesting results.\r\n\r\nI take the view that if you can show that a repeatable pattern of brain activity [per imaging method] *always* correlates with a particular behaviour or reported experience, then you will have established an \"identity\" between the two. I believe these kinds of identities are being discovered, albeit in a very limited extent so far. The key point, I think, is to recognise that if a particular pattern of interaction [AKA a cell assembly, \'singularity\', repertoire, or whatever] appears consistently and time and again then it can be said to \'exist\'. IE it is real - relatively speaking - and resists any tendencies in its environment to either destroy it or at least radically transform it.\r\n\r\nIf this be the case, and I think it is so, it is completely reasonable to believe that such intermittently repeatable activity patterns are dynamic logical structures capable of representing things other than what the patterns themselves are.

Essentially, it considers perceptive consciousness (awareness, will, qualia, ideation, understanding, etc.) as being fundamental qualities of ZP absolute space, coupled with higher order fields of mind/memory, and NOT as epiphenomena of any physical/material substance or process.  IOW, the experiencer IS the zero-point of perceptive focus, itself. For vision and hearing it is that focal point in the center of the brain.  For taste, touch and smell it is the point of the cellular sensation.  All of which zero-points are entangled with the individual center of our conscious self (see my diagrams).  Also, it considers mind as a higher frequency phase order resonant field entity, in itself, that is separate from the physical brain-bodyâ€™s EM fields.  Trying to correlate any of that with conventional material science is an exercise in futility. ;-)\r\n\r\nHowever, I have no objection to the neural correlates of consciousness (which my theory has nothing to say about) being \"approachable by science\".  But, none of that can explain the primal cause and nature of perceptive consciousness, its non locality, its experience of qualia, or how it is connected (holographically and resonantly) to mind, memory, brain, body, senses, etc.â€”all of which is thoroughly explained by my ABC modelâ€¦ Which, incidentally, does not depend on any conventional scientific theories, although it predicts the correct ones and is confirmed by many recent scientific discoveriesâ€¦ And, also, it can be self evidently verified by several simple â€˜mind experimentsâ€, in addition to being far simpler and more direct than any possible physical/material explanation. Obviously, considering all that, I could not place my camp in any higher camp where there are any sub-camps that contradict my theory or its propositions.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, I will continue to hold my primary camp outside of this \"approachable by science\" camp, or place it under a highest level camp possibly titled, \"approachable only by a new scientific paradigm\" or, \"Consciousness is fundamental and non explainable by the â€˜scientific methodâ€™\".   \r\n\r\nLenny','2010-07-18 05:57:05','2010-07-18 05:57:05'),(987,96,48,'\r\nHi Lenny,\r\n\r\nBetter late than never! ;)\r\n\r\nI\'m struggling with most of this so help me out.\r\n\r\nAre you saying that some parts of your theory aren\'t experience able, or sharable, or controllable or demonstrable in any way to others?\r\n\r\nThe Representational Qualia theory predicts we will soon be \'effing\' the ineffable, something many doubters are predicting will not  be possible.

Conventional science may have got something of a bad name with those serious about understanding the nature of consciousness, because in the last 20 years consciousness studies has been dominated by the 19th century paradigm of Newtonian physics, plus the Cajal based late 19th century neuron doctrine as extended by mid-20th century computing concepts. This approach tended to go unquestioned in a consciousness studies sector that was driven by philosophers and psychologists with surprisingly little reference to actual scientific research. Neuroscientists were happy to leave this hot potato to other disciplines, while physicists were rudely told not to intrude.\r\n\r\nBut as some of your postings imply modern science is quite different from the stuff touted in consciousness studies. The quantum vacuum or spacetime are viewed as both fundamental, and as discrete rather than continuous. The quanta are less fundamental as distortions or oscillations of the spacetime/vacuum. I would agree with the implication above that attempts to understand consciousness at the classical level lack explanatory power. I am less clear why you should need to go beyond the idea of consciousness as a code, pattern or measurement in this fundamental spacetime.\r\n\r\n Simon','2010-07-19 15:19:21','2010-07-19 15:19:21'),(993,96,48,'Hi Brent,\r\n\r\nYou ask:\r\n\"Are you saying that some parts of your theory aren\'t experienceable, or sharable, or controllable or demonstrable in any way to others?\'  \r\n\r\nI respond:\r\nNo. What I am saying is that the ABC model is a new scientific paradigm that does not depend on any conventional physicsâ€”but which can be easily demonstrated by simple mind experiments and proven by rigorous causative logical analysis based on absolute fundamental principles, conservation laws, and reasonable propositions that consciousness (as the necessarily stationary detector/receiver/perceiver of vibratory image information, and the applier of directed willful intent) cannot be explained as an epiphenomena of any vibrating material substances, electrochemical processes, or energy fields... \r\n\r\nTherefore, awareness and will, along with the subjective experience of qualia must be fundamental qualities of inert and unconditioned, yet infinitely potentially energetic, absolute (pre-cosmic) zero-point space.  It also implies that the universe is a hologram, with all its structural and experiential information stored and transmitted through resonant EM fields of varying harmonic frequency phase orders. This is obvious, since it can be shown experimentally that all visual information of the entire cosmos converges as a hologram in every zero-point of view in 3-D space.  \r\n\r\nFurther, this stationary aspect of each conscious POV is essential for us (as a fixed reference) to enable our instantaneous analog positional computation and judgments coordinating our body positions with holographic audio/visual mental images that correspond exactly with the objective 3-D outer world.  Thus, a baseball fielder can instantaneously judge the ballistic trajectory of a fly ball and catch it on the run and jump.  This implies that unconditioned consciousness is the fundamental nature of every zero-pointâ€”located everywhere in 3-space... And thus, all forms of matter are potentially conscious... Thereby, limiting the brain to serve only as the transponder (transformer, processor, converter, channel switcher, etc.) between the sense receptors and ZP conscious awareness, and as the similar transponder between the ZP conscious will (or intention) and the neuromuscular system...  With all of it mediated, holographically, through the brain\'s EM field, coupled with the resonant higher order hyperspace fields of mind-memory, which are linked directly to conscious awareness and will (at their zero points of origin).  \r\n\r\nThus, there is no separation between our individual self-consciousness and every other point of consciousness within the same reference frame (bounded by the highest order harmonic field surrounding that frame\'s ZP center of origin).  Such fields, that interpenetrate and surround the body, would have to extend (at their highest harmonic level) at least as far as the visible universe.  This, however, is limited only by the finite resolution of our physical visual sense mechanismsâ€”although, our zero-point of consciousness, capable of spiritual discernment (in deep Samadhi meditation) of near infinite frequency modulations, can have no such finite limits. \r\n\r\nBTW, the only way to really understand all this, since hyperspace information fields, along with consciousness and qualia are truly ineffable (and always will be)â€”is to subjectively experience their internal processes directly... By going into deep mind control meditation, such as explained in Patanjali\'s yoga aphorisms, while using my ZP field diagrams (along with my explanations of how consciousness actually works) as \"seeds\".  It also helps to have some knowledge of how a hologram worksâ€”using the 2-D surface of those fields as the information media.  When you can understand that a color can only be defined, transmitted, and detected as a particular wavelength of light (at any frequency phase order spectrum)â€”and that color is not a physical property of the object it reflects from or transmits throughâ€”then everything will become as clear as the color of a fresh strawberry or a stripe on an American flag (neither of which are made out of the same stuff). Therefore, its obvious that color cannot be a physical property of the brainâ€”since our experience of a particular color is determined solely by our zero-point of perceptive consciousness discriminating its frequency/wave length. Thus, if a particular red is 675nm, any object reflecting that wavelength will be experienced as that shade of red (unless defects in the eye or the brain processing distorts or changes the frequency).  \r\n\r\nYou also say:\r\n\"The Representational Qualia theory predicts we will soon be \'effing\' the ineffable, something many doubters are predicting will not be possible. Of course, when we eff the first qualia to all such doubters, their theory will be so falsified, that they must convert to our camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you saying there is no way to do anything like this for the doubters of ABC?\"\r\n\r\nI respond: \r\nNo.  But, since â€œeffingâ€ the ineffable means explaining in words or symbols what cannot be explained in such objective termsâ€”such as the actual subjective experience of consciousness, i.e., what is the smell of a rose or the taste of honey?  Therefore, I doubt if there can be such a thing as a physical (i.e., objective) representation of qualia (which is entirely a subjective experience). \r\n\r\nI am also sure thatâ€”since such a theory totally contradicts the reality that there has never been any evidence of the physical representation in the brain of a color (or a qualia of any kind)â€”the recording and transmission of a particular color must be either as a modulated frequency in a radiant field, or as a chemical structure that reflects or transmits a particular wave length of light and absorbs all others.  Consequently, there is a serious doubt in my mind that your representative qualia theory can ever be proved.\r\n\r\nAs for the ABC model... All current post modern physics and cosmic observations, are beginning to get closer and closer to a new paradigm of physics postulating a self generating cyclic physical universe, as part of a metaphysical cosmos, self created in an infinite beginningless and endless plenum that is omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent... All of which more and more looks like the holographic principle and hyperspherical fractal field structure predicted by this ABC model... Which is based on infinite unconditioned consciousness, infinite spin momentum on infinite axial angles of fractal field involution, and evolution through resonant morphogenetic fields, which contain (in totality) infinite structural and experiential information, as holographic wave interference patterns on their spherical surfaces.\r\n\r\nAll any doubters of the ABC model have to do is prove that there is any other scientifically methodological way to explain the cause and nature of consciousness (awareness, will, qualia, thinking, knowing, creating, doing, etc.) along with fully describing the physical (and hyper or metaphysical) mechanisms linking it experientially (at the informational level) with mind, memory, brain, body, senses, world, etc.  And after that, they would still have to unequivocally prove that evolution is based on random or chance mutation.\r\n\r\nUntil then (which I don\'t doubt will be long after I leave this world, if ever;-)â€”I will continue to stick to my guns, and keep on searching for the final proof that will convince everyone, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the only true deific principle or everlasting impersonal God, is the infinite consciousness of unconditioned Absolute Space itself.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, it\'s only this total cosmos that can be \"The mind of God\"â€”which both Hawking and Einstein hoped to read.  However, in my ABC view, it\'s an open book... And, \"The Word\" is the first cyclically vibrating manifestation of the initial triune field of cosmogenesisâ€”which contains, as holograms on its infinite multidimensional field circumferences, all the intelligence, knowledge, wisdom, or structural/experiential information accumulated from all its previous cycles of manifestation.  Thus, everything and everyone is interconnected in a simple and complete model of phenomenal reality that can serve as a fundamental basis to explain anythingâ€”scientifically, philosophically, or religiouslyâ€¦  With all of it being based on a fundamental law of cycles, inherent in original spin momentum, that governs all phenomenal existences (which includes infinite possible universes).\r\n\r\nSo, this ABC theory of cosmogonists, mind and consciousness, with virtually no explanatory gaps, will continue to stand, alone and apart from all other scientific or philosophical theories that contradict its basic premises and underlying fundamental principles.

Many other things  can be interpreted to represent this pattern of light, but it must be interpreted, and is not fundamentally like it.\r\n\r\nWe can represent it\'s causal properties, with the firing of the optic nerve, but - again, the optic nerve firing \'pattern\' must be interpreted as the light, in order to know what the firing represents.  All of this is only causal properties, and when everyone takes this to the quantum level, it is still the same - just causal properties, which can be interpreted as representing other causal properties.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to causal properties, or what it is causally like, something, at least in our brain, also has ineffable phenomenal properties.  Our brain uses such to represent 650 nm light.  And like everything else, you must interpret this red, as meaning something that is reflecting 650 nm light.\r\n\r\nBut, unlike simple \'codes and measurements\' these phenomenal properties are ineffably more.  There is something red is phenomenally like, and it is not like green, so together they can represent 650 and 500 nm light.

Certainly any AI that is able to compete with us is going to immediately realize the absurdity and worthlessness of such a singular goal, and quickly work with everything it has till such an obviously insane goal is corrected.\r\n\r\nWe humans have many bad goals hard wired into us, and we constantly work to discover, â€˜resistâ€™ and overcome them.

And that\'s just what the ABC theory is the culmination of.\r\n\r\nHowever, the scientific method\'s rules require that any scientific theory must be both falsifiable and predictive.  And, although my ABC hypothetical model of cosmogenesis, mind and consciousness, as stated in my camp, is predictive of all observed physical phenomena -- it is not falsifiable by any verifiable conventional scientific theories or observations.  In fact, it is perfectly in accordance with all proven theories of relativity and quantum dynamics (although it proposes an entirely new non-materialistic paradigm of fundamental initial causal or primal beginning of a cyclically manifest metaphysical and hyperspatial, multidimensional cosmic reality, that resolves all conventional science\'s inconsistencies, paradoxes and anomalies). \r\n\r\nTherefore, since it proposes a new paradigm of fundamental (pre-spacetime) eternal unconditioned consciousness, coupled with potential energy (as infinite spin momentum) along with infinite holographic constructive informationâ€”which underlies all phenomenal existence, and consequently, thereby making consciousness a ubiquitous quality of absolute zero-point spaceâ€”it does not fall under the conventional \"scientific method... Just like all string, SUSY, or M theories.  Nevertheless, these theories are still \"scientificâ€â€”but also, not in accord with the conventional \"scientific method\".\r\n\r\nSo, the only way my ABC theory could be accommodated under this camp would be if, in its title, the words \"scientific method\" were substituted by the word \"scienceâ€â€”and if, in its statement, all claims that unconditioned consciousness, or potential awareness, will, qualia, etc., can ever be made effable (or explainable in words or scientific terms) are eliminated.  \r\n\r\nIt would also be useful if, in this camp statement, there would be a clear distinction between such unconditioned or access consciousness, and the conditioned phenomenal consciousness/unconsciousness of all sentient beings... Since my ABC theory postulates a fundamentally conscious pre cosmic space-time, whose subjective quality splits into infinite zero-points at the center of the ZPE or spin momentum originating and empowering all particle standing waves (and their composite forms)... These conscious ZPs are spread out ubiquitously, between zero and infinity, throughout total multidimensional (hyperspherical} spacetime... This, being the root of the holographic principleâ€”as another postulate of the ABC model, as well as being the rootless root of the phenomenal consciousness, and the superficially described, but not entirely explained physical world of scientific materialismâ€”which you and all the rest of this camp are talking about.    \r\n\r\nActually, in spite of the new paradigm, the ABC model is entirely in conformance with the proven theory of general relativityâ€”except for its assumptions about the cause of gravity, and its limitation only to our lowest order physical/material space-time (which, incidentally, prevented Einstein from achieving a unified field theory using the scientific method). \r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies my position. \r\n\r\nLeon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2010-11-05 03:38:38','2010-11-05 03:38:38'),(1013,96,48,'I think a lot of people would agree that string theory and various other speculations in cosmology are not scientific theories because they cannot be falsified by any reasonably foreseeable experimental technology.

Almost all of these have a remit to preserve the Newtonian world view, to deny agency or any other importance to consciousness, and to exclude consciousness from any position in the physical universe. None of their arguments seem remotely convincing, but established prestige and modern scientific career structures and research funding ensure that they dominate the debate, if you can call it a debate. However, this does not mean that some established science that has the undoubted advantage of having resisted falsification might not provide some help.\r\n\r\nIn neuroscience the Crick-Koch approach has unacceptably blurred the distinction between a correlate, which merely has a relationship to something else, and a proper explanation of something. Nevertheless, the best established correlate, the gamma synchrony might give us a clue about where to look. Recent studies on this synchrony come close to solving the binding problem, and while this does not explain consciousness, it is true that consciousness is usually identified as a unity, and this might give us ideas on what to look for.\r\n\r\nRecently I have become unhappy with the term \'quantum consciousness\'. This is partly because the loose usage of the term \'quantum\', itself a dire consequence of quantum science having been minimised in the mainstream education system. The other is that it is no easier to explain consciousness in terms of individual quanta or their interaction than it is in terms of classical features such as synapses. I would rather think in terms of consciousness and fundamental physics, with processing in the brain gating access to the fundamental level of the universe, which is the only place where it seems possible to place the qualia.\r\n \r\nSimon','2010-11-14 17:27:08','2010-11-14 17:27:08'),(1028,96,48,'We agree that testability is a problem in string theories due to their many solutions.  However, even if they can be boiled down to one solution such as in M or superstring theory with 11 dimensionsâ€”they still can make very little progress in explaining subjective consciousness or qualia... Which, as already noted, appears to be a property of the fundamental level of the Universe... Or, as proposed in the ABC model; â€œA fundamental quality of the pre-cosmic unconditioned absolute (zero degrees K) space located everywhere at the ZPE origin of all spacetime particle-wave fields and their composite atomic, molecular and material formsâ€.\r\n\r\nThis is based on already proven scientific theories that all matter is fundamentally electrical and of a standing wave nature. (Ref.: Einstein, Maxwell, Schrodinger, Pauli, de Broglie, Wolff, etc.)... And, such a space would necessarily act as a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC)â€”which would account for the non-locality of consciousness, as well as its entanglement throughout the body... So that a pinprick felt in a finger is also perceived globally by our center of individual self-consciousness... Whichâ€”according to the overall fractal field surrounding the entire body at the highest possible frequency phase order in hyperspace (the eternal human soul)â€”is located in the naval chakra. See: http://leonmaurer.info/ABCimages/Chakrafielddiag-fig.col.jpg\r\n\r\nWhile the ABC model also cannot be generally or particularly falsified using conventional scientific methodsâ€”many of its precepts such as the wave nature of matter, the hologram nature of all constructive and reflective information, can be inferred or demonstrated both observationally and mind experimentally.  \r\n\r\nFor example it\'s obvious that all reflected visual information observed from any viewpoint in spacetime, converges as a wave interference pattern at each such zero-point. This implies that the information describing the structural forms of the entire cosmos is actually a hologram.  \r\n\r\nAs the universe and all its parts, no matter how complex, can be viewed in perfect 3-dimensions and color quality in the mindâ€”this is direct evidence that the mind is a radiant field which carries the total information as interference patterns in every zero-point on its spherical surface, and that zero-point consciousness, in conjunction with its surrounding spin momentum-sourced coherent radiation, is a hologram image detector, holographic re-constructer, and perceiver.  (Actually, as all we really see reconstructed holographically is the 2-D image on the retina, after being transformed back to a 2-D hologram in the mind fieldâ€”it requires both eyes viewing the outer world hologram from different anglesâ€”to enable us to experience, and be able to judge actual 3-D depth.)  All this, incidentally, is perfectly consistent with already proven holographic principles a well as all the fundamental laws of electrodynamics.\r\n\r\nSince we see such images as if viewed from a single point in the center of our headâ€”it\'s self evident that the image in the mindâ€”after converging to each point on the eye lens, focused onto the 2-D retina, and processed by the neural network of the brainâ€”must be a hologram.  Thus, the brainâ€™s EM field would have to carry the image as wave interference patterns on its 2D spherical surface... And the mind field would necessarily be a resonant, higher order radiant harmonic field in hyperspaceâ€”whose virtual particle frequency/mass-energy is closest to the infinite cyclic spin momentum of the conscious zero-point.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, it becomes obvious that consciousness or unconditioned subjectivity remains outside of all metric space and time, and apart from all physical/material or energetic processes.\r\n\r\nIn light of all the aboveâ€”there doesnâ€™t seem to be any credibility in considering observer or perceiver/responder consciousness (awareness, will, qualia, etc.) as quantum effects or epiphenomena of neurological, physiological or biological processes. \r\n\r\nApparently, other than its neural correlates, and possibly psychological processes, consciousness, in all its subjective aspects, cannot be explained by the present scientific method.\r\n\r\nLeon\r\n\r\n','2010-11-16 08:02:45','2010-11-16 08:02:45'),(1029,1,60,'\r\nWelcome, everyone, as supporters of this new survey topic on wiki leaks.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to point out a few things for the new people about how things work here, what the possibilities are, and to make sure everyone is participating as they desire or intended.\r\n\r\nCurrently, So far, there is only the [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/119/1 Agreement Statement], which is basically the survey question, or anything that everyone agrees on.

So I\'m always interviewing as many people as possible in hopes of finding ways to improve things so it makes sense to more people with less effort.  I\'m wondering how many of you ever discuss and refer to this stuff with others, experience such, and possibly think of new ways to improve things because of this?\r\n\r\nI\'ve collected what I believe to be the best of these ideas and have produced a new version of the statement.  The changes aren\'t very significant.  I removed a bunch of redundancy and made things more concise.  I now user 650nm light, instead of 700nm for red, and some other things like that.  I think the most significant change is I think I now have a much better way to describe why phenomenal properties are ineffable with simple cause and effect observation, which hopefully in turn better describes what phenomenal properties are, compared to causal properties which require the proper interpretation to get the abstracted meaning out of them.  I rewrote the first several paragraphs of the statement using this.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if possible, before I officially submit this new version of the camp statement, it would be great if I could get as many of you as possible to review it, and help us make it even better.

If this is what Dennett etc are talking about, it has no bearing on the reality or relevance of qualia. I sometimes think it would be better if we talked of mapping rather than representation. If we think of the map of a metro system in a large city, the pattern of coloured lines for different routes on a piece of paper bears no resemblance to the actual concrete tunnels and metal vehicles, but is very adaptive for getting around the city.\r\n\r\nIn talking about unity in the brain I am a bit surprised you don\'t mention the global gamma synchrony. Recent studies seem to come pretty close to conclusive demonstration of this as the unifying factor. Where an image is masked and therefore not coming into consciousness, it produces only local gamma synchrony, but where it is not masked and comes into consciousness, it produces global gamma synchrony. See \'Dynamic Coordination in the Brain\' from MIT Press (2010) or the summaries under the Neuroscience categories on www.quantum-mind.co.uk. Of course the synchrony remains only a correlate of consciousness and provides at best only hints about how qualia/consciousness arises.\r\n\r\nIt might also be worth talking about recent work on subjective choice and experience of reward in the brain. Choice or preference might be seen as what distinguishes conscious from automated behaviour. Studies show that in the orbitofrontal cortex the response correlates to the subjective appreciation of sensory input rather than the strength of the signal. See Edmund Rolls \'Emotion Explained\' and \'Memory, Attention and Decision Making, also \'The Orbitofrontal Cortex\' by Zald and Rauch and Subcortical Structures and Cognition by Kosiol and Budding. These are also summarised on the quantum-mind site. I feel generally we should more at new developments in neuroscience and less at philosophy and psychology. However the views of the above writers on consciousness itself can be safely ignored as they have been down loaded from philosophers.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to go down a similar route to Bernard Carr in looking for consciousness as a fundamental in the quantum vacuum/spacetime. Other explanations all seem to end with an explanatory gap.\r\n\r\nWhere I struggle with the statement is the ideas for exchanging qualia between minds in the near future.

Thanks for the contribution.  For me, the first I really heard of gama synchrony was at last year\'s TSC conference.  I still don\'t know much about it.  Perhaps you could make a proposed addition to the statement about this?\r\n\r\nAs far as struggling with the idea of exchanging qualia between minds, would you agree that there is some set of neural correlates that is our knowledge of a red strawberry, and another different set of neural correlates that is representing out knowledge of a green leaf?  And that somehow, there are neurons, such as those in the corpus callosum, that unifies all this together so we are aware of the red knowledge of the strawberry, and the green knowledge of the leaf, together all at once, aware of how different each is, and what these difference represent?\r\n\r\nOf course, just how such phenomenal properties are properties of and how these might be unified, is still obviously yet to be discovered.  But there are lots of possibilities, in things like Lehars wave theories, and as you point out, in quantum vacuum/space-time.  There are still lots of yet to be falsified theories about how this could be done, many crude frameworks of these theories are already appearing in the various sub camps.  To me, how it is done isn\'t so important at the higher level \"Representational Qualia Theory\" level.  The important thing at this higher level is simply representationalism, that a quale is a property of the final result of the perception process, and that we should someday be able to expect to find some way to find out if any of us do, indeed, have such things as red / green inverted qualia from the rest of us just as surely as our left hemisphere knows what red is like for our right hemisphere.\r\n\r\nToday, everyone just focuses on all the disagreement there is, at the less important levels, leading everyone to believe there is no agreement, whatsoever, in this field, on anything.  But I believe there is already a huge expert consensus on these general higher level ideas, it is just that nobody has had the ability to measure for or see this.\r\n\r\nWould you be interested in moving the panexperientialism camp into a supporting sub camp of the Representational Qualia Theory camp, or object to it if someone else proposed such a change to that camp?\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n','2011-04-20 02:28:10','2011-04-20 02:28:10'),(1044,96,48,'Gamma Synchrony\r\nThis is based on research by Lucia Melloni and Wolf Singer at the Max Planck Institute published in 2010. For further reading see, \'New Horizons in the Neuroscience of Consciousness\'.\r\n\r\nThe authors discuss studies that show that conscious perceptions produce different types of brain activity from unconscious percepts. In particular, consciousness is demonstrated to produce long-range synchronisation of gamma oscillations in widely separated neural assemblies. The approx. 30-90 Hz oscillation of neuronal spiking, known as the gamma wave can become synchronised across large areas of the brain. The authors suggest that the synchronisation of widely distributed neuronal activity meets some of the requirements for explaining how conscious experience arises in the brain.\r\n\r\nThe brain comprises specialised although connected processing areas, and for these to become unified, it has to overcome the problem of representation in different modalities, such as hearing, seeing etc. In this research, it is proposed that the processing of spatially separated neuronal assemblies is bound together by means of the gamma synchrony.\r\n\r\nNeurons are known to be synchronised into coherent assemblies, and these assemblies are suggested to signal the presence of particular features to other neural assemblies. This process is suggested to give rise to to a distributed representation of the external environment. Neuronal assemblies form and dissolve rapidly, which could account for the easy shifting of consciousness from one focus to another.\r\n\r\nSynchronisation also allows better control of interaction between neurons. Thus excitatory inputs are seen to be effective at a particular point of the oscillation cycle, but are ignored at other times. This means that groups of neurons that oscillate in synchrony will be able to signal to one another, and that groups that are out of synchrony will be ignored. This mechanism can function within neural assemblies, but also between spatially separated assemblies. The frequency and phase of oscillation can alter to influence signaling.\r\n\r\nStudies suggest that local processing is unconscious, whereas large scale activity such as reciprocal signaling between separate neural assemblies is a correlate of consciousness. This is argued to be a \'small worlds\' system, where there is co-existence between local and long-range networks. In the brain, it is suggested that the local networks are between neurons only a few hundred micrometers apart within layers of the cortex, while the long-range networks run mainly through the white matter, and thus link spatially separated areas of the cortex. It is these latter that can establish the global coordination that is correlated to consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe authors propose that masking experiments are a good way of studying consciousness, because this allows the same stimuli to be either unconscious or conscious. In a study undertaken by the authors, words could be perceived consciously in some trials but unconsciously in others (Melloni et al, 2007). Local gamma synchronisation was similar in both cases, but with consciously perceived words there was a burst of long-distance gamma synchrony between the occipital, parietal and frontal cortices. Also subsequent to this burst, there was activity that could have indicated a transfer of information to working memory, while an increase in frontal cortex theta wave activity may have indicated material being held in working memory. Words processed at the unconscious level could lead to an increase in the power of the gamma frequency range, but only conscious stimuli produced increases in long-distance gamma synchronisation, plus possibly theta activity looks to be a requirement for consciousness.\r\n\r\nEven the authors admit that the gamma synchronisation is just a correlate, and does not explain how consciousness actually arises. However, it does look like providing an explanation of how conscious perceptions are unified. The redness of fruit in one assembly is synchronised or entrained with the greeness of leaves in another assembly, and the blueness of sky in still another, plus the humming of bees and song of birds in the more distant but still synchronised assemblies of the auditory cortex.\r\n\r\nOne aspect which is touched on, but not enlarged on in the mainstream literature is that there is a zero or near zero time lag in the synchronisation of spatially separated neural assemblies, which bears the signature of quantum entanglement. Between 2007 and 2010 studies of photosynthetic organism demonstrated the existence of possibly functional quantum coherence and entanglement in biological systems even at room temperature, partly refuting the claims of the much-hyped (Tegmark 2000) paper.\r\n\r\nAs for constructing something that could communicate qualia, in principle anything that is physical can be built, but the prospects for something like the above in the near term looks daunting. The photosynthetic studies suggest working at the level of coherent electrons within the interior of neurons, bearing in mind that a neuron is said to be more complex than London. The difficulties of the relatively more straight forward requirements for quantum computing are not encouraging in this respect       ','2011-04-22 14:48:28','2011-04-22 14:48:28'),(1047,96,48,'Hello Junius,\r\n\r\nI would like to reproduce your excellent write up on Gamma Synchrony at my blog.  may I have your permission please?\r\n\r\nLink to my Blog : http://beyond-advaita.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nI will appreciate a line or two about you as an intro.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards,\r\nramesam','2011-04-25 12:24:58','2011-04-25 12:24:58'),(1050,96,48,'\r\nYes Junius,\r\n\r\nThis is great stuff.

In Wikipedia I see that conduction velocity in myelinated neurons is anything from 2 metres per second up. For unmyelinated neurons the velocity is shown as from maybe 0.4m/s up to 1.2m/s. The myelinated axons are connecting cortical regions separated by as much as 20cm or more [allowing for curves], whereas the unmyelinated axons are connecting neurons located within one or two millimetres of each other. \r\n\r\nThe best theory of brain functioning seems to be that the different features of objects of interest are represented by activity in different and characteristic locations around the cortex, \"topographically\" as it were. The massively parallel and redundant connection paths across the brain allow for simultaneous activation of several distinct, and self-assertively robust neuron combinations [AKA cell assemblies]. In each case resonance and mutual reciprocal stimulation will be what holds the particular cell assemblies together as effective candidates for control of muscle movements at any particular moment. \r\n\r\nIn this view, consciousness is what happens when candidate cell assemblies get linked in with the cell assemblies that are currently representing the person/body\'s \"self\". The self as such is a construct which fulfills the need for the guidance system to have a \"you are here and facing that way\" indicator and to have a focus of personal identity features which make up one\'s story of self at the moment. Part of our self identity story involves maintaining a belief in continuity of person. I have lately come to suspect that our ability to empathise is a necessary part of this. I think this is because we need to be able to both distinguish self from others yet also to identify self with others, ie keep absolutely certain the difference between family or friends on the one hand versus food and other mere objects on the other. \r\nMark Peaty','2011-04-28 18:47:25','2011-04-28 18:47:25'),(1065,96,48,'I think desidimona asked for a couple of lines of my background.

It has changed significantly from the version I sent out to some of you on request.

As always, I welcome any thoughts, pro, con, or whatever.  I\'d especially like to know what you think of giving a name to this \'\'\'\"qualia interpretation principle\"\'\'\'.  I think this is an important way of thinking about the difference between computer knowledge and conscious knowledge.  There are many \"theories of consciousness\" out there that completely fail to address this important issue, and to me, thereby, can\'t be valid.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n= Representational Qualia Theory =\r\n\r\nhttp://canonizer.com/files/epist2.gif\r\n\r\nOur working hypothesis is that a phenomenal red property or quale is not a property of something like a red strawberry reflecting 650nm light, or the initial cause of a perception process.  It is, instead, a property of the final result of a perception process.  The world finally fully realizing this will be far more significant than when they switched from a geocentric solar system working hypothesis and such could lead to what could turn out to be the most significant scientific revolution / achievement of all time.  The early significant lead this camp has ahead of all others is exciting evidence that, at least for some experts and hobbyists, we might have already made a great bit of progress in this direction.\r\n\r\nInformation theory mandates that information or knowledge must be represented by something.  If you know something, there must be something that is that knowledge.  If you know lots of phenomenal stuff like the color of surfaces of some strawberries, together with the color of some leaves, and cognitive information like how sweet the most red ones are, there must be something that is all this information and it must be somehow bound together in the same world of awareness so we can distinguish between red and green, so that we might interpret them appropriately enabling us to choose the red ones.\r\n\r\nAll information that comes to us through our cause and effect based senses is done so in the abstract based on a \'\'\'\"Quale Interpretation Principle\"\'\'\'.  This principle is why qualia are ineffable.  This type of abstracted information we get from interpreting our senses has two important related properties:\r\n\r\n# What this abstract information is represented by, by design, doesn\'t matter, as long as it is interpreted properly.\r\n# Anything that represents this abstract information must be properly interpreted to get the abstract information represented by it.\r\n\r\nThis abstractness extends beyond our senses into any detection instruments, and includes all our current computational devices.  What represents red in a computer, by design doesn\'t matter.  The only important thing is that whatever is doing the representation have possible differentiable states, and that such differences be interpreted properly.\r\n\r\nWith consciousness, on the other hand, information is represented and distinguished in a fundamentally different way.  The red and green phenomenal properties of our knowledge of a strawberry patch, how they are bound together, and the fact that we know what they are phenomenally like and how they are different, is what allows us to be able to differentiate them and interpret each of them appropriately.  Unlike all abstracted information coming to us through our senses, what this information is represented with, what they are phenomenally like, that we are aware of the difference is all important and what enables us to choose the red ones.\r\n\r\nWe are interpreting the surface of the strawberry, the light, and all the other intermediate representations as something very different than what the original fundamentally is.  There is no phenomenal color, taste, warmth, sound, or pain, beyond our senses, that we know of.  There is only the abstracted information about their causal behavior of reflected electromagnetic radiation of a certain wavelength, chemical content, kinetic energy motion of molecules, acoustical vibrations, bodily damage or other cause and effect behavioral properties which our brain interprets and represents as something very fundamentally different.  The above image by Steven Lehar is purposefully depicted with color only inside the head.  The black and white lines of the outside world represent this type of abstracted information, for which we only know abstracted information about.\r\n\r\nAll we can currently know of the external world is this kind of abstracted information about it.  Because of this must be interpreted properly requirement, such perception cannot tell us what something is phenomenally like, beyond our ability to interpret it properly.  This \'\'\'\"Quale Interpretation Principle\"\'\'\' is the reason for the veil of phenomenal perception and is why phenomenal properties are ineffable or blind to interpreted cause and effect based observation.\r\n\r\nDiscovering and tracking ever more detailed and comprehensive abstracted information about the neural  correlates that are our knowledge, alone, will never reveal to us what they are subjectively experienced as.  Whatever neural correlate is that is responsible for a point of subjective red on the surface of the strawberry we are aware of, would be much more likely to reflect grey light (if it is \'grey matter\'?) than 650nm light.  So obviously interpreting it as grey, would not be the correct interpretation of a neural correlate that we experienced as a point of red.  Scientists may already have far more abstract information about neural correlates, than required to discover a relationship between the abstracted information they are learning, and what they are subjectively like to experience.  And as long as they continue to only look for ever more detailed abstracted information about such, and never ask what is it like to experience such, they could go on forever missing what is all important for consciousness, and how to properly interpret such.\r\n\r\nAll we know of the surface of the strawberry, is how our cause and effect based senses are phenomenally representing it.  If something in our brain is ineffably like something, there also exists the possibility that the surface of the strawberry, and much else in nature, has ineffable phenomenal properties we are blind to, along with their causal or behavior properties we only now just represent as something very different than what the original is truly like.\r\n\r\n\r\n','2011-05-01 22:53:24','2011-05-01 22:53:24'),(1075,1,65,'\r\nHi Eric,\r\n\r\nWelcome to the milestones survey.

I think that the internal simulation or model that is built on qualia is fundamental.  There must be some means of internal modelling, abstraction and simulation for a thinking entity to make predictions, and anticipate solutions to problems which would lead us to infer that such an entity is intelligent.  But one must also consider that an entity which percieves and has the capacity for abstaction but exhibits no response can not be determined to have intelligence from external observation - akin to locked in syndrome.  Therefore I must conceed that modelling behavior is a necessity for building useful AI, such that we can recognize an entity\'s external responsiveness to internal cognition and thus interact with it in a meaningful way.  However the internal model (qualia) can perhaps be represented in many different ways, not strictly as we would see it or hear it or percieve it.  How does a cephalopod think?  How does it model the world?  How does it assume that there may be somthing interesting inside a mason jar and figure out how to open it?  Where is the line between feedback loops which generate impulses and the kind of behavior that is generated by more sophisticated pattern recognition through abstraction which we recognize as awareness?\r\n\r\nOur current technology has exceptional power for modeling the world in arbitrary ways and we can also model behavior, but we need lean and mean pattern recognition to reach the goal of AGI.  My suspicion is that Wolfram\'s research may lead to a processing architecture that can provide a kind of universal pattern recognition and fill in those arbitrary levels of abstraction.','2011-05-07 13:26:06','2011-05-07 13:26:06'),(1077,1,65,'Dystopian said:\r\n\r\n    \"I think that the internal simulation or model\r\n    that is built on qualia is fundamental.\"\r\n\r\nYay!

One of the benefits, if the gamma synchrony was seen to resolve the binding or unity of consciousness problem, would be to allow efforts to be concentrated on qualia or subjectivity which looks like the real hard problem. One of the difficulties in consciousness studies has been a tendency to get bogged down in areas that are not the essential problem.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am now sending a shortened version of the bit on the gamma synchrony. You are welcome to integrate either version or some editing of either or both of them into your rewrite.\r\n\r\nThe Gamma Synchrony\r\n\r\nStudies show that conscious perceptions produce different types of brain activity from unconscious percepts. In particular, consciousness is demonstrated to produce long-range synchronisation of gamma oscillations in spatially separated neuronal assemblies. The 30-80 Hz gamma oscillation of neuronal spiking can become synchronised across large areas of the brain binding together spatially separated neuronal assemblies. This connectivity is suggested to meet the requirements for binding together the unity of consciousness.\r\n\r\nNeurons are known to be synchronised into coherent assemblies, and these neuronal assemblies are suggested to signal the presence of particular features to other neuronal assemblies. This is proposed to give rise to a a distributed representation of the environment.\r\n\r\nSynchronisation also allows better control of interaction between neurons. Excitatory inputs are effective at a particular point of the oscillation cycle, and are ignored at other times. Groups of neurons that are not oscillating in synchrony are ignored. This can function both within and between neuronal assemblies.\r\n\r\nStudies suggest that local gamma processing is unconscious, but that longer range reciprocal signaling between spatially separate neuronal assemblies is a correlate of consciousness. Studies involving masking of stimuli have allowed the same stimuli to be either unconscious or conscious. In one study words could be perceived unconsciously in some trials but consciously in others. Local gamma synchronisation was similar in both cases, but with consciously perceived stimuli there was a long-range synchrony between the occipital, parietal and frontal cortices. The conscious stimuli also produced activity indicating a transfer of information to the working memory, and frontal cortex theta activity may indicate material being held in working memory.\r\n\r\nThe gamma synchrony is just a correlate and does not explain how consciousness arises, however it does seem plausible that the physical basis of consciousness is in some way related to this process.     \r\n\r\n','2011-05-10 17:56:07','2011-05-10 17:56:07'),(1086,96,48,'I find Junius\' statement on gamma synchrony totally acceptable, but it doesn\'t take us very far.

Whether this knowledge is mistaken or not, has nothing to do with whatever nature this subjective feel has.  Currently, for us, you are just waving your hand, and making impossible claims that we have some mistaken knowledge that doesn\'t really exist.  For us, you must do more than just make a claim that we can know something, without having something that is the mistaken seeming, with a mysterious hand wave.  You must provide a real mechanical or testable process of what this \'subjective feel\' is, and how it comes into being, without it being anything.  For example, might these dispositional properties be modified or enhance or connected in some way (perhaps like the corpus callosum) to enable us to think or make judgments about my red is like your green (or my green after a red green inverter is spliced into the perception process), in some way?\r\n\r\nRepresentational Qualia theory is making real, mechanical predictions that are very falsifiable - that there is something in our brain that reliably and detectably has these phenomenal properties, and that this is our knowledge.

This could lead to the most significant scientific revolution of all time.  The early significant lead this collaboratively developed camp has ahead of all others is exciting evidence that, at least for some experts and hobbyists, we might have already made considerable progress in this direction.\r\n\r\nInformation theory mandates that information or knowledge must be represented by something.  If you know something, there must be something that is that knowledge.  If you know lots of phenomenal stuff like the redness of some strawberries, together with the greenness of some leaves, and cognitive information about how sweet the reddest ones are, there must be something that is all this information, and it must be somehow bound together in the same world of awareness that we experience.\r\n\r\nAll information that comes to us through our cause and effect based senses does so in the abstract. This type of abstract information suffers from a \'\'\'\"Quale Interpretation Problem\"\'\'\'.  This problem is why redness is ineffable.  The cause and effect way this type of abstracted information comes to us by properly interpreting our senses has three important related (dis) functionalities:\r\n\r\n# What this abstract information is represented by doesn\'t matter, as long as it is interpreted properly.\r\n# Anything that represents this abstract information must be properly interpreted to get the abstract information represented by it.\r\n# External abstractly represented information has no relationship to any fundamental properties the media doing the representation may or may not have.\r\n\r\nThis type of problematic abstractness extends beyond our senses into any detection instruments, and includes all our current computational and simulation devices.  If you are going to represent information, you must have some media which can assume distinguishable states. Abstracted information being communicated someplace is, by nature of its design, only concerned with detectible and distinguishable causal local properties of the media. Regardless of what the properties of this media are, or may be like, the only relevant part is your interpreting these behaviours properly to get the abstract information being represented. External abstract information has nothing to do with what any of the intermediate representations might be fundamentally like, either phenomenally or behaviourally. With the design of whatever represents red in a computer (say red is 1 and green is 0), the only important thing is that whatever is doing the representation should have possible differentiable states, and that such differences be interpreted properly so the machines abstract algorithms can pick the items represented by ones, while avoiding the zeros. The process of interpreting abstracted representations is a local process isolated from the information and abstract algorithms being processed on them.\r\nWhile with consciousness, what redness and greenness are like and how they are different in phenomenally motivating ways is a critical part of our conscious knowledge and is what enables us to consciously distinguish between different things so that we can choose the red over the green. These properties must have some way of being bound together and integrated with our cognitive reasoning ideas about them, memory of such, and so on.\r\nIf we used traditional cause and effect observation that suffers from the â€œquale interpretation problemâ€, in order to examine the surface of the brain, or even to examine individual neurons and groups of neurons, and by this means we managed to observe the physical correlate for redness, we might ourselves only observe grey light reflected from these surfaces. However, it would be incorrect to interpret the subjective experience as greyness rather than redness.\r\nIf we are going to make any progress towards explaining consciousness, we must do more than just this. We must first have a clear understanding that there is more than just causal properties we should be looking for and understand this â€˜â€™â€™quale interpretation problemâ€™â€™â€™. We must understand just â€˜â€™â€™whatâ€™â€™â€™ to look for â€“ qualia, â€˜â€™â€™whereâ€™â€™â€™ to look for it â€“ a property of a neural correlate and finally â€˜â€™â€™howâ€™â€™â€™ to look for it â€“ via effing the ineffable or some type of repeatable and sharable binding or grounding process. The longer nuts and bolts neural researchers only do the former, and only focus on abstracted and incorrectly interpreted causal properties of neurons, the longer they will continue to have success regarding causal behaviour, but fail to achieve what could arguably be the greatest scientific discovery of all time, in uncovering the relationship of the phenomenal properties to the neural correlates.  This discovery includes the mapping and sharing of all possible experiencable phenomenal properties to the behavioural properties we already know so much about, and with it the discovery of what physics is phenomenally like.\r\n\r\n== Reduction of unified complex knowledge to fundamental qualia ==\r\n\r\nThe final result of the perceptual process is the appearance of a visual sensation in the phenomenal visual field (A). This is associated with the acquisition of cognitive knowledge (B) correlating to an external physical object.  Processes A and B are mediated by different brain mechanisms.  In associative agnosia the patient has intact phenomenology but defective epistemology about visual objects. In blindsight the opposite occursâ€”no phenomenology but functioning epistemology. Visual phenomenology (A) and visual epistemology (B) are processed by different brain mechanisms and correspondingly lost by damage to these regions.\r\n\r\nThe word \'red\' can be used in its common sense mode as naming a causal property such as the surface of a strawberry reflecting 650 nm light.  But this usage is ambiguous referring to both the property of an object reflecting 650 nm light and to the correlated but physically quite separate process of the phenomenal experience redness in the brain.  It is possible to add a red/green inverter anywhere in the perception process of a strawberry patch.  Whenever you do this, the still reflecting 650 nm light strawberry is then being represented with phenomenal green, and the leaves are represented with phenomenal red.  Dreams, hallucinated strawberries, and other visual brain states can also be composed of phenomenal, red even when there is no 650 nm light coming to our retinas from the external world.\r\n\r\nhttp://canonizer.com/files/250px-Inverted_qualia_of_colour_strawberry.jpg\r\n\r\nWe think that the redness of the phenomenal red strawberry amongst the green leaves is out beyond our eyes, and that we are directly aware of it.  But this is a misrepresentation - an optimization selected by nature.  In reality, these sensations only arise after the perception process, in the model of a unified conscious world* perceived by us as our everyday reality.\r\n\r\nAt the center of this phenomenal 3D world modelling is our experience of the body-image. This is the model of the physical body that we experience and that is also constructed by a representative mechanism. All somatic sensations, including â€˜phantomâ€™ limbs and phantom limb pain, are located in the body image not in the physical body.\r\n\r\nInside our experience of our body-image is an experience of our \"self\" or \"spirit\" or \"I\". This \"I\" is represented as looking out of our eyes within this body image. But of course, this spirit image, unlike everything else in this phenomenal world, has no referent in reality. However, though it has no referent in reality, this in no way means our spirit does not exist. This phenomenal \"spirit\" is what we really, literally, and spiritually are. During \"out of body experiences\" this image of our spirit* leaves our body-image, but remains in the unified phenomenal world of our conscious awareness.\r\n== Effing the Ineffable ==\r\nSince this theory predicts that redness is not a property of the strawberry, but instead a property of our knowledge of such, we are faced with a communication problem. Currently we canâ€™t know if my redness is anything like yours or anyone elseâ€™s redness. How can we eff that which is ineffable.\r\nIf this theory is borne out, and we achieve any kind of ability to reliably predict just what it is that has redness, weâ€™ll be able to do things like use our traditional instruments to detect the same thing going on in othersâ€™ brains. Any such would provide us tools to ground our abstract communication so that it could become phenomenally meaningful between brains.\r\nAs an example, we could look for whatever it is that we reliably know has person Aâ€™s redness in person Bâ€™s brain. Then we could say to person B that this is person Aâ€™s red. To which person B might say something like, â€˜No, that is my greenâ€™, or maybe, â€˜Yes, that is very similar to my redâ€™, or any of many other possible responses that would enable us to map out and communicate, in a predictably reliable way, at least some of the more obvious differences between our brains.\r\nThis would be a kind of weak effing of the ineffable, which can be achieved via any ability we may achieve to reliably ground what we mean by abstract words in such a personally experiencable way as this. The next section describes a stronger method of effing the ineffable.\r\n\r\n==Gamma Synchrony, the Binding Problem and the Unity of Consciousness:  Strongly Effing the Ineffable ==\r\n\r\nWhen there is a red strawberry represented in the left hemisphere (right field of vision) and a green leaf represented in the right hemisphere (left field of vision), that we are aware of as a unified phenomenal world that bridges the corpus callosum, and unifies vision into a conscious whole where we can compare and contrast their phenomenal differences.\r\nStudies show that conscious percepts correlate to different types of brain activity from unconscious percepts. In particular consciousness is demonstrated to correlate with long-range or global synchronisation of gamma oscillations in widely separated neural assemblies, whereas unconscious signals correlate only to local synchrony. The approx. 30-80 Hz oscillation of neuronal spiking known as the gamma wave can become synchronised across large areas of the brain. It is suggested that the synchronisation of widely distributed neuronal activity meets some of the requirements for explaining how conscious experience arises in the brain.\r\nIt is proposed that the processing of spatially separated neuronal assemblies is bound together by signalling between them. Neurons are known to be synchronised into coherent assemblies, and these assemblies are suggested to signal the presence or absence of particular features in them to other neural assemblies. This process is suggested to give rise to a distributed representation of an object or an environment. Neuronal assemblies are self-organising and form and dissolve rapidly, which could account for the easy shifting of consciousness from one focus to another.\r\nSynchronisation also allows better control of interactions between neurons. Thus the excitatory inputs are seen to be effective if they arrive at the depolarising slope of a neuronal oscillation cycle, but are ineffective at other times. This means that groups of neurons that oscillate in synchrony will be able to signal to one another, and groups that are out of synchrony will be ignored. This mechanism can function within neural assemblies, but also between spatially separated assemblies. The frequency and phase of oscillation can alter so as to influence signalling.\r\n\r\nStudies suggest that local processing is unconscious, whereas large scale activity such as reciprocal signalling between separate neural assemblies is a correlate of consciousness. It is these latter that can establish the global coordination that is correlated to consciousness. \r\nIt is proposed that masking is a good way of studying consciousness, because this allows the same stimuli to either be used in unconscious brain processing, or to be translated into phenomenally experienced brain states, depending on how long the signal is sustained for (probably +/- 30 ms). In one study words could be perceived in some trials but not in others. Local gamma synchronisation was similar in both cases, but with consciously perceived words there was a burst of long-distance gamma synchrony between the occipital, parietal and frontal cortices. [1-3. Melloni, L. et al , 2007, Melloni, L. & Rodriguez, L. 2007, Melloni, L. & Woolf, S,] Also subsequent to this burst, there was activity that could have indicated a transfer of information to working memory, while an increase in frontal cortex theta wave operations may have indicated material being held in working memory.\r\nWhatever the actual relationship between the global gamma synchrony and consciousness, this spatially extended synchrony does appear to provide a plausible explanation of how conscious perceptions are unified. The redness of fruit in one neuronal assembly is synchronised with the greenness of leaves in another assembly, the blueness of the sky in still another, plus the humming of bees and song of birds in the more spatially distant but still synchronised assemblies of the auditory cortex.\r\nGiven that in principle anything physical can be built, in the longest run, this theory predicts it will be possible to discover and use similar mechanisms to produce artificial hemisphere-like structures integrated into our visual fields that can reliably reproduce various phenomenal sensations upon command within one single phenomenal world of awareness with the red, green, and everything else we are already phenomenally aware of.  With such an enhanced mind, we should be able to throw a switch and say something like: \'This is what my red is like\'.  To which the augmented person may say - \"Yes, that is the same as red for me.\"  Or, we might be surprised to find that she represents 650 nm light with something dramatically different.  We refer to such a phenomenal communication ability as [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/102/2 \'effing\'] the ineffable.\r\n\r\nVarious brain interface experiments are increasingly getting close to \'effing\' abilities.  Just one demonstration of such is documented in this [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.09/vision.html wired article].  If we should achieve even a remote and rare but reliable ability to \'eff\' the ineffable as predicted by this theory via any such methods, whether strong or weak, this will prove this theory to be the only sound theory, demonstrating the explanatory power that is hard to detect in functionalism and other mainstream consciousness thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n==Choice, Preference and the Emotional Brain: The Turing Test Isn\'t Enough ==\r\n\r\nCertain aspects of emotional processing appear to be basis of choice and preference. As something that is not replicated in classical computing, they look to be the best way of distinguishing between a conscious entity and any classical computer or robot. Emotional processing in the brain revolves round a system of \'rewards\' and \'punishers\'. Representations of the external world are produced in the cortex, but these are initially neutral in terms of reward value, until they are projected to other regions, and particularly the orbitofrontal cortex, which samples the entire sensory range. The orbitofrontal is thought to encode the relative value of rewards. It responds more strongly to sensory inputs related to rewards than to neutral stimuli. Thus it responds more to the pressure of velvet than the pressure of wood.\r\nIn particular, studies show that the level of orbitofrontal activity correlates to the subjective pleasantness of sensations rather than the strength of the signal being received [4-6.  Rolls et al 2003c, 2003d, Anderson et al, 2003]. In responding to a face, activity increases in line with the subjectively assessed attractiveness of the face. The orbitofrontal also process shifts in preferences. In a choice of apples and carrots, apples may be preferred, but when bananas are added, the preference can shift to bananas. Thus some aspects of orbitofrontal processing could be argued to make sense only in terms of qualia, rather than any form of non-conscious communication from the external world. The orbitofrontal can be seen as a brain region that creates a common neural currency that weigh up the qualia of differing rewards, or even of rewards that have no common characteristic such as holiday or a healthy bank balance.\r\nThe orbitofrontal projects to the subcortical basal ganglia, a region that lies upstream of actions and behaviour. The orbitofrontal also project to the dorsolateral frontal seen as the executive and long-term planning region of the brain. The basal ganglia integrate the reward assessment of the orbitofrontal, plus inputs from many other parts of the cortex, the amygdala and other parts of the limbic system. The basal ganglia are not thought to take any part in cognitive computation, but instead act as a form of mixer-tap for a wide spread of inputs, and as such select or gate for material processed by the cortex including the orbitofrontal. Dopamine and other neuromodulators play a role both in the processing of the basal ganglia and in the delivery of the qualia of subjective reward in the nucleus accumbens, which is itself part of the basal ganglia. The determining role of qualia in these processes can be seen as contradicting much of mainstream consciousness studies.\r\nIt is absurd to think the only way to determine the nature of anotherâ€™s consciousness is through a \"Turing Test\", rooted as this test is in the more limited mid-twentieth century knowledge of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. To phenomenally know the nature of qualia, the most important question to ask is something like: \"What is Red like?\"  And to know if the conscious entity is telling the truth, you must know something about the representations being used in the remote mind, and have the ability to at least causally observe the neural correlates responsible for these properties, and have something like \'effing\' abilities to ground these abstracted cause and effect representations, in a way that reliably guarantees we are interpreting them correctly.  In other words, you must really know what it is phenomenally like.\r\n\r\nIf you ask an intelligent system that is based on abstract knowledge what its red knowledge is phenomenally like, depending on the level of self-referential information it has access to, it could reply that it is an abstracted knowledge based system in which the information is represented by, doesnâ€™t matter.  It might provide some information about the specifics such as, red is represented with 0xFF0000, revealing depth and resolution information about its knowledge and so on.  Some people might consider such system to be a non-phenomenal â€˜zombieâ€™ that could behave identically to a phenomenal system as far as easily picking red strawberries goes.  Despite such, if it demands something like â€˜red is a property of the surface of a strawberryâ€™, it will simply be revealing its stupidity, or if it is smarter than that, and claiming it is a phenomenal system, perhaps in line with its attempt to pass a Turing test, it will be lying.\r\n\r\nAnd if it is really smart, like some humans are now becoming, it will be able to learn what a phenomenally wonderful and rewarding quality red is, what it is a property of, and that effing is required to communicate and be aware of such.  Like intelligent humans that want to know what otherâ€™s red is like, it will want to know what red is like for us.  It will likely start looking for ways to eff such ineffable knowledge to itself, so it too can experience the same wonderful stuff and finally phenomenally say: â€œoh THAT is what red is like for you!â€.  An example from Sci-Fi includes Commander Data in Star Trek, who is often asking about and seeking after obviously valuable phenomenal things.\r\n\r\n== Problems with other working hypothesis ==\r\n\r\nMany people often compare the idea of qualia to many failed theories of the past such as vitalism, phlogiston, either and so on. The problem with many of these arguments is they entirely miss classify the nature of qualia as [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81/16 John Gregg] states in his [http://home.comcast.net/~johnrgregg/hardprob.htm essay on the hard problem]:\r\n\r\n   \"The problem is that subjective consciousness (or qualia) is not\r\n   something we drag into the picture to explain something or other\r\n   that we observe, as elan vital was invoked to explain what we\r\n   observe about life, or to use another example reductive\r\n   physicalists like, as the luminiferous ether was invoked to explain\r\n   light waves in the 19th century. Consciousness is the raw data,\r\n   the observed thing that needs explaining. It is the light, not the\r\n   ether.\"\r\n\r\nPeople like Daniel Dennett make similar categorical errors when they claim we don\'t have qualia \"it just seems like we do\" (7. Consciousness Explained P. 375). The very meaning of â€˜to seemâ€™ is to have knowledge that doesn\'t accurately represent its referent. Qualia have to do with the nature of our seeming. Whether or not they are mistaken representations of something else is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nA few people claim to be representationalists, while promoting the use of terribly confusing and ambiguous terms such as our representations are \'transparent\' in a way that allows us to be aware of what we are looking at.  Or they say things like \"every quale is a representation\".  As soon as you say something ambiguous like our representations are \'transparent\' this allows people to quickly jump to the obviously erroneous conclusion that phenomenal red is really on the surface of the strawberry, and that our representations, because of their \'transparency\' allow us to be aware of such.  See liberal usages of this word in the works of [https://webspace.utexas.edu/tyem/www/ Michel Tye], [http://www.philosophie.uni-mainz.de/metzinger/ Thomas Metzinger] and others.\r\n\r\nWhen you say something like \'every quale is a representation\', again this confuses the issues and does not accurately mechanically portray what is the representation, and what is being represented.  The key thing to grasp is that the qualia, subjective experience, or the fact that looking at a strawberry does seem like something rather than either nothing or a string of 0s and 1s is a brain state.  It usually correlates to particular oscillations in the external world but bears little or no resemblance to them.  Philosophers who say that we only seem to have the qualia of red strawberries miss the point or make a category error in that it is the seeming bit that they need to explain.  If they are scientifically literate they already know that the qualia bear little actual resemblance to the external object.\r\n\r\nA few so called representationalists also name something they call the phenomenal principle - \"That if there sensibly appears to a subject to be something which possesses a particular sensible quality then there is something of which the subject is aware which does possess that sensible quality.\" And they deny such a principle.  We believe such a principle, but think it is much better to simply say our brains use qualia to represent things and that our knowledge is made of such.  What these qualia are like, how they are different, and how we are aware of such in a unified way, is critically important to the process.\r\nThe word representation has to be used because this is the normal way this form of brain processing is described in the literature. Nevertheless, this word is unfortunate in suggesting that our brain states bear some resemblance to the external world. It might be better to talk about \'mapping\'. For instance, the two dimensional coloured lines that comprise the map of a metro system in a large city bear little physical resemblance to the reality of concrete tunnels and metal vehicles, but this map is adaptive for navigating the city.\r\nThis is a very brief list of issues present here. Steve Lehar has a much more comprehensive review of the history of the epistemological debate, and the various problems and confusions that have and still do exist, working from an assumption that representational qualia theory is correct. This comprehensive academic presentation is contained in his [http://cns-alumni.bu.edu~slehar/webstuff/consc1a.htm#hist A History of the Epistemological Debate section of his â€œThe Function of Conscious Experienceâ€ paper. It includes the following:\r\n    â€œThe critical realists all agreed on the fact that the sense\r\n     data are independent of the object of perception itself.\r\n     However the question of whether the sense data are part\r\n    of the mind, or whether they are aspects of the external\r\n    object is one on which critical realists differed in subtle\r\n    ways. In a book on critical realism by a consortium of\r\n    authors, Lovejoy, Pratt and Sellars claim that the senses\r\n    are completely â€œthe character of the mental existent â€¦.\r\n    although its existence is not givenâ€, whatever that might\r\n    possibly mean, while Drake, Rogers, Santayana and Strong\r\n    agree that the data are characteristic of the apprehended\r\n    object, although â€œthe datum is qua datum, a mere essence,\r\n    an inputed but not necessarily actually existent. It may or\r\n    may not have existenceâ€, whatever that might possibly\r\n    mean. So the critical realists solved the problem of\r\n    sense-data by defining a unique kind of existent, which may\r\n    either be part of the external object, or of the internal\r\n    mental state, but in any case it has a status\r\n    of quasi-existence, which supposedly escapes the problems\r\n    inherent in identifying it explicitly as either an internal or\r\n    external entity. Epistemological confusion inevitably leads\r\n    to a confused philosophy.â€ \r\n\r\n== Various types of Property Dualism ==\r\n\r\nEveryone in this camp considers themselves to be \'property dualists\', in that they believe qualia are not only important, but are different properties of nature than traditional causal properties we can know of abstractly.  As David Chalmers refers to it, phenomenal qualities are \"Part of the basic furniture of nature, just as the laws of physics are.\"  Some theoreticians tend to call them \'physical properties\' but we believe this is not a good name since subjective phenomenal properties are also best thought of as \'physical properties\'.\r\n\r\nThere are different types of property dualists.  David Chalmers is probably the most famous property dualists and argues that phenomenal properties, in some \'hard\' way, \'arise from any functional equivalent organization, from neurons to silicon transistors.  This version of property dualism is currently the most well accepted, and is represented by the [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/8 Functional Property Dualism] sub camp.  Recent gains in a competing camp that might be on the verge of taking the lead is very different in that it predicts that there is some neural correlate, or material substance that simply has the phenomenal properties our brains use to represent conscious knowledge with.  Without the right stuff, you can\'t have the same quale.  This theory is represented by the [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/7 Material Property Dualism] sub camp.  If Material Property Dualism is effingly demonstrated to be true by science, it will falsify any theory or possibility that we might be in an abstracting simulation.\r\n\r\nThere are also other supporting yet to be falsified theories such as [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/14 Higher Dimensional property dualism] first proposed by C.D. Broad, and currently supported by [http://canonizer.com/support_list.asp?nick_name_id=97 John Smythies] and Bernard Carr.  This theory predicts phenomenal properties exist in the branes of string theory, or in some higher dimensions.  In addition to these, there is an increasing number of other supporting sub camps indicating there is far less consensus on just what qualia are, as compared to how well accepted this more general Representational Qualia theory is.  The supporters of such sub camps as the [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/17 Mind-Brain Identity Theory], and [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/9 Computational Functionalism] are subsets of the supporters of these general ideas.  Some proponents of \'Mind-Brain Identity Theory\', for example, do not believe in the importance of qualia, or that qualia are properties of our knowledge.  The supporters of these particular camps, as indicated by the fact that these are sub camps to this camp, show that they do espouse these additional doctrines.  We fully expect parallel branches of such camps to form outside of this Representational Qualia camp to properly represent the people that espouse these different versions of mind brain identity theory and functionalism.  The [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/37 Detection, Reaction, and Association] camp being one example of a functionalist theory that ignores qualia that is a competitor to this camp.\r\n\r\n== What will the future be like if this theory turns out to be the one ? ==\r\n\r\nOur brains and brain states are private from those of others, and give a first person experience, whereas what comes from other peoplesâ€™ brains is public and third person.  Though there are unified, grand and glorious phenomenal spirit* worlds within each of us, our spirits are still trapped behind this phenomenal veil of perception.  Our cause and effect based senses and their extension via traditional scientific instruments and communication tools allow abstracted communication between these worlds, and about the causal behaviour of the world in general.  But, beyond this abstracted information about the behaviour of what is outside, we are still phenomenally isolated and blind to any phenomenal properties beyond what is in our own world of conscious awareness.  When we hug someone, we still only know half of what is important.\r\n\r\nWe believe science could be on the verge of getting an objective handle on these blind to traditional cause-and-effect observation phenomenal properties that could enable technologies such as \'effing\' the ineffable.  This discovery will finally resolve how they work, how they are unified, and many other conundrums of self and epistemology philosophy has been struggling with for so long. We believe such a discovery will be the most significant, profound and world changing of scientific achievements to date. For such an achievement will literally ultimately enable the piercing of these spirit prison walls and eventually allow our phenomenally unified spirits to be freed into a world that is surely much more than just cause and effect behaviour.  If this theory turns out to be true our spirit* worlds, in addition to being shared and merged, will soon be growing in resolution, extents, diversity of phenomenal qualities, and many way\'s we surely can\'t even fathom yet, let alone know what it will be like.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€â€References:-â€œâ€â€\r\n1.)

We do believe in â€˜spiritsâ€™ as defined here, but we do not believe in ghosts.\r\n','2011-07-17 15:45:44','2011-07-17 15:45:44'),(1115,96,48,'\"...Another question - many would consider an AI computer to be not conscious, or at best a \'zombie\' for which there was nothing it was like to be it or know what it knows. Do you believe an AI robot, or maybe even my digital camera, to be conscious, similar to the way I am, when I look at or take a picture of a sunset?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer is no, not similar to the way you do.  Why; #1, Consciousness is \'relative\' to the observer and is has a different sensation for a living human than a sub-atomic particle, or a digital camera or AI robot   #2, Under my theory, us and other living things have biological/physical brains and senses, that have abilities to harness consciousness in ways that artificial intelligence or robots will never have (or at least never have in any of our lifetimes).  The camera and AI Robot has a similar consciousness to a big rock, it the camera has a screen that shows us physical awareness of the sunset, but the cameraâ€™s consciousness is only aware of the hand that is holding it, and the gravity of earth that is keeping it on our hand.  I believe that feelings, and ideas might be born from consciousness but they cannot exist without the proper tools, ie. brain, and senses to feed the brain.  The AI Robots (and everything for that matter) consciousness will always be limited to the tools it is working with.  I believe us, and any life for that matter, has very unique biological equipment that harnesses consciousness in ways we do not yet understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦Also, you mentioned: The very first thing to do is to define the term â€˜consciousnessâ€™, and then pointed out some things consciousness is not, but I could never get exactly what you define consciousness to be? Did I just miss it, or can you provide a short and concise description of what it is?â€\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the toughest part.  Iâ€™ll give my best crack here, and Iâ€™ll add to the camp statement;\r\n\r\nConsciousness is the force that creates absolute from probability relative to the observer. The field of consciousness, or awareness, is derived from the anything that interacts with the observer.  Outside of that field of consciousness, and only relative to the observer, everything exists only as a probability.  Our brain and senses are biological tools that give us awareness, and harness consciousness.  Smaller objects, such as an atom of carbon, has only electrical magnetic force and gravity as tools that give it awareness, and as such it uses very little consciousness by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦The current agreement statement defines consciousness, or at least the most important current topic of this survey to be about what consciousness is like, as in what is stuff like redness and how does this relate to the underlying correlates, and so on. Perhaps you would take issue with this definition, and would push to get this agreement statement changed, so we can all agree with what is most important about consciousness, and what we should be surveying for here?â€\r\n\r\n\r\nI re-read the agreement statement, and I believe to answer the questions outlined, we need to first answer something more fundamental â€“ what is consciousness, or where does it come from?  The questions in the agreement statement refer to how consciousness reacts with physical / biological properties of our senses / brain.  My theory is the step forward to resolve the more fundamental question of â€˜what is consciousnessâ€™ first, just as the many of the other camps do in the survey.  I would vote to adding the fundamental question first, and then how it applies to phenomenal nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦.Along those lines of the so far to date, subject of this survey topic, from within your theory, what is \'redness\'? Is it a property of the surface of a strawberry, or something reflecting something like 650 nm light? Or is it a property of something in our brain, as predicted by the currently leading consensus Representational Qualia Theory?  How is redness, greenness, and all if it unified together so we can be aware of it all in all of its ineffable phenomenal diversity, all at the same time? And, finally, will we ever be able to \'eff\' such ineffable stuff, to know what other minds are like, if they are different, to resolve the philosophical problem of other minds, and so on? To me, these are the important questions we are and should be surveying for regarding consciousness. I\'d love to know if you agree?â€ \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is of course a property of something in our brain, just as many people are color blind, many others are not, and im sure many organisms can â€˜senseâ€™ variations of red that we do not.\r\n\r\nI believe that Representational Qualia Theory makes a lot of sense, and my theory does not necessarily agree or disagree with it, but to me it is a biological / physical sensation or function that wouldnâ€™t exist without a brain such as ours.

At this time span, the same signal the image will sometimes be recognised consciously, and sometimes processed unconsciously. Studies of single neurons show that where the image is not consciously recognised, the neuron remains close to its baseline activity, but where subjects report conscious recognition of the image, the neuron fires at or near 50 Hz (the strong end of the main part of the gamma range associated with consciousness).\r\n\r\nIn the recent suggested master copy for the camp statement, we mention a rather similar study on a brain wide scale. The same visual image is shown to the subjects, but either masked, so that it does not enter consciousness, or viewed so that it can enter consciousness. Where the processing is unconscious, gamma synchrony arises only locally in one part of the brain, but when consciousness is reported by subjects, global gamma synchrony arises between spatially separated neuronal assemblies.\r\n\r\nI think it reasonable to argue from these examples that there is a demonstrated physical distinction between unconscious sensing and reacting, which comprises the majority of brains processing, and processing that involves consciousness. I suppose in the last resort you canâ€™t definitely say which type machines have, but in that it is demonstrated that the brain can do a lot at the non-conscious level, and there is therefore no specific requirement for consciousness when a machine makes an automated response, Occamâ€™s razor would suggest such machines be regarded as not conscious, while we continue to look for what it is the flips the brain from non-conscious to conscious.\r\n\r\nIf we are looking at entities from the outside without the benefit of scanners, we would probably assess their consciousness on their tendency to show preferences or make choices that could not be demonstrated to be the product of a hard-wired algorithm. This tendency too is mentioned in our draft master copy.\r\n\r\nEdmund Rolls and others have demonstrated that activation in the orbitofrontal cortex, the region most involved in assessing the reward/punisher value of sensory inputs, is correlated to the subjective reactions of humans being studied, rather than the strength of the external signal. Thus the pressure of a piece of wood produces a stronger activation in the somatosensory cortex than that of a soft piece of velvet, but in the orbitofrontal, the velvet that has reward/pleasure value produces more activation than the wood, and via the basal ganglia, dopamine nuclei and other areas this is seen to influence behaviour. It is also argued to give the organism a flexibility of response to the environment that would be impractical to programme in via genes.\r\n','2011-07-18 20:05:27','2011-07-18 20:05:27'),(1131,96,48,'For those with a bit more time, the piece below tries to illustrate the argument about choice and preference mentioned in the last posting in a more whimsical way.\r\n\r\nThe Scene:  An elegant villa in the south of England  _____  a long time in the future.\r\n\r\nâ€¦â€¦â€¦  As she entered the villa, Snodgrove (non-conscious android butler) approached and spoke to her, â€˜If you please, Miss Freya, thereâ€™s a young woman here to see you.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜Oh, I didnâ€™t think, I had any appointments. Can you remind me who she is?â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜She doesnâ€™t have an appointment, Miss Freya,â€™ Snodgrove replied. â€˜She appeared here this afternoon, rather distressed and dishevelled, I must say. Actually, she really wanted to speak to Miss Cecily, but when I said that this was your home now, she said that she would be happy to speak to you.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜Well, thatâ€™s big of her. So what have you done with this woman?â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜Sheâ€™s in the bathroom in the south apartment. She had rather a large quantity of mud attached to her legs, so I suggested some ablutions might be in order. I also took the liberty of providing the young lady with a bottle of the new wine you had delivered. She expressed a preference for that type of wine.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜What! Not the Villa Irene ReservÃ©! That costs a fortune. I was meaning that for special guests.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜I am full of apologies for my error, Miss Freya. If my performance has been less than satisfactory, perhaps you feel that I should visit the reprogramming department. I was acting on commands indicating that I should show as much hospitality as reasonably possible towards visitors.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜No,â€™ Freya replied, â€˜you acted quite correctly.â€™ She knew that she had put the setting for Snodgroveâ€™s inclination to hospitality close to the maximum, to offset a certain tightness with money that she was well aware of.\r\n\r\nLeaving Snodgrove, she went swiftly up the wide staircase of the Villa Irene. She would get rid of this girl as quickly as possible. Probably one of Cecily groupie followers. On top of that, this girl was now drinking her very expensive wine, and probably not even appreciating it. The thought of that made her cross, and she threw open the door of the bathroom without even knocking and marched in.\r\n\r\nFreya looked at Persephone, and everything about Persephone surprised. She was very beautiful for one thing. But there was something else. There was something naÃ¯ve and helpless about this girl. She looked at Freya as if she was some sort of revelation. Usually the Cecily followers combined a drowned rat appearance, with a rather calculating glance, as if they were estimating what they could get out of one.\r\n\r\nâ€˜Well, youâ€™ve certainly made yourself at home,â€™ Freya remarked, observing Persephone as she lounged in the bath.\r\n\r\nâ€˜Oh, hallo, I hope you donâ€™t mind? Your butler suggested I had a bath, while I was waiting for you.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜No. Not at all, but I was just wondering, who you are.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜Oh, nobody really. My nameâ€™s Persephone. I was just looking for Cecily.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜Cecily only lived here when she was a child.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜I see. Well, perhaps you could tell me where to find her.â€™\r\n\r\nFreya sat down on a bathroom stool, quite close to Persephone, and peered closely at her, â€˜That really depends on who you are, and why you want to see her.â€™\r\n\r\nPersephone didnâ€™t reply immediately. She seemed rather stumped by this apparently simple question. â€˜Just tell me who you are and why you want to see Cecily,â€™ Freya persisted.\r\n\r\nâ€˜Well __ Iâ€™m nobody really,â€™ Persephone said eventually. â€˜I met \r\n\r\nCecily at a lunch yesterday and afterwards I thought perhaps she could __ er __ help me.â€™\r\n\r\nIn answer, Freya laughed sarcastically. â€˜Oh, yes,â€™ she said, â€˜Cecily was always such a little do-gooder, and so charming and silver tongued. Just the sort of person to help waives and strays or whatever youâ€™re supposed to be. Well, I can tell you, she was a real little cow when she was a child. Always getting me into trouble.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜But even so, perhaps she could help me,â€™ Persephone said, and Freya thought she detected more than a note of desperation this time.\r\n\r\nâ€˜I might feel more inclined to help you if you would let onto me what exactly Harcourt-Smythe has been doing at Dragonâ€™s Gate. I know heâ€™s been hanging around there recently.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜He wasnâ€™t there all the time. He has a job in London.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜That isnâ€™t really an answer to my question, is it?â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜No, I suppose not,â€™ Persephone said. â€˜Well, I think, he was supposed to have designed a conscious android.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜I donâ€™t believe you.â€™\r\n\r\nThere was a pause after this, and Persephone looked baffled. Finally she said, â€˜you donâ€™t believe me? Why not?â€™\r\n\r\nâ€˜Because I think that there never will be any conscious androids. Iâ€™ve tried to build them myself, and Iâ€™m telling you they canâ€™t be built. The whole subject of consciousness reduces the brightest minds to meaningless pulp. And please donâ€™t tell me that other robots can piece together a conscious robot. However powerful their brains, they can never really get the hang of what we mean by consciousness.â€™\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s not true. I can,â€™ Persephone replied.\r\n\r\nâ€˜Well, of course you can,â€™ Freya said. â€˜Youâ€™re not an â€¦ â€™ Then she stopped. There was a pause before she spoke again. â€˜What did you say then? What did you mean?â€™ Freya said at last.\r\n\r\nPersephone was looking at her, and this strange girlâ€™s face seemed full of fear and confusion, â€˜Iâ€™m an android, a conscious android. I ran away from Dragonâ€™s Gate, because I didnâ€™t like the way I was expected to behave.â€™\r\n\r\nFreya was surprised by fear, a fear of the unknown and the unnatural. Could this girl who was so obviously human be just a robot? If it was true, then Dragon had made a leap forward in the outward appearance of their androids. Could they have devised something as warm and sensual as this girl?\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, Freya recovered herself, and began to have doubts. She asked herself whether this was perhaps an elaborate practical joke, perhaps some silly prank of Cecilyâ€™s or else a novel way of gaining commercial secrets. Anyway, there was a simple way of settling the question. Freya activated a small hand held device that she used for diagnosing problems with her own androids. She gasped slightly when she looked at the screen, which imaged Persephoneâ€™s interior. It left her in no doubt that this so-seeming natural girl was a machine.\r\n\r\nFirst, she had to investigate more carefully. She knew now that this girl for all her warmth and vitality was just a machine, but was this machine conscious or just a very clever simulation? Well, her own prior efforts to build conscious androids had at least taught her what she had to look for. She would need to detect apparently subjective preferences or choices of one course of action over another that were sufficiently unlikely to have been included in Persephoneâ€™s programming or training.\r\n\r\nFreya knew that robots were just thinking machines. But the human brain had a two-way connection between the rational and emotional centres. If something damaged that connection, it became difficult for a human to make even trivial decisions. There was nothing mystic about the emotions. They were based on the same type of brain cells as the rational area of the brain. However, it was not just a matter of a brain signal from the emotional area. It was the conscious experience of the emotion that gave it its special punch in making decisions or forming preferences. It could help to decide between things that were narrowly balanced or insist on something that was not wise from the rational point of view, such as more wine or sex with the wrong person.\r\n\r\nFreya reached for the wine bottle, meaning to fill one of the bathroom tumblers. â€˜My God, youâ€™ve drunk nearly the whole bottle!â€™ she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nâ€˜Yes, I liked that wine.â€™\r\n \r\nâ€˜Like! Androids canâ€™t like or dislike. Although, I suppose if youâ€™re really conscious â€¦ â€™ that was a lucky break, Freya suddenly realised. There was absolutely no point in programming an android to drink wine in the absence of its owners. Doing that in itself suggested some form of will and preference. She had realised that one could never be totally certain that another entity was conscious. It had to be inferred. You knew you were conscious yourself. You inferred that other people were conscious, to the extent that their behaviour resembled your own. Over a very long period of time, most people had inferred that androids and other computers and computer-driven machines were not conscious. It seemed to her that the important difference leading people to that conclusion had been that androids never expressed their own preference for particular things or particular courses of action, never indicated that they felt that they liked something or that they wanted to perform a particular action. You could argue that in humans these preferences were themselves just the product of genes or nurture, but we all knew that at the point of action, they derived from a subjective experience, and that was what gave them their special punch.\r\nPersephoneâ€™s behaviour with the wine had been human rather than robotic. There was no apparent reason for her to drink the wine, except for a small amount when humans were present in order to give a companionable impression.\r\n\r\nFreya decided that she would try some more-or-less formal tests. She thought she would make some further use of Persephoneâ€™s wine-drinking propensities. She had Snodgrove bring in several glasses of different types of wine. Persephone mustnâ€™t see the bottle, because she might have been programmed to admire particular wines.\r\n\r\nWhen Persephone had sampled a rather ample amount of each wine, Freya asked her to rank them in order of preference. A normal android could only grade wines according to its knowledge of the quality as signified by the label. Confronted with this sort of blind tasting, the android would be stumped. It would remain silent, or apologise for its inability to answer the question.\r\n\r\nPersephone, however, ranked her preferences with hardly a momentâ€™s hesitation, and added for good measure that she preferred the original bottle to any of the subsequent wines.\r\nFreya was shocked when she heard that answer. She knew that Persephone was a machine, but she had for some time believed that no one would ever build a machine that could do what Persephone had just done.\r\n\r\nFor her second test, Freya had Snodgrove wheel in several racks of clothing. â€˜Your stuffs all ruined from running around in the woods,â€™ Freya remarked. â€˜Youâ€™d better choose something you like from these.â€™\r\n\r\nThis should be revealing, Freya thought. It was once again the sort of open choice that the manuals warned against. The android could become confused, and might simply put on the first garments that came to hand, with a possibly incongruous effect. It was better for the user to give clear instructions.\r\n\r\nPersephone spent a considerable time flicking through the rails, but the actual process of choosing did not appear to bother her. She tried on lots of things and generally took an uneconomic amount of time. She did ask Freyaâ€™s opinion a few times, but then tended to disagree with her, and didnâ€™t seem to have any notion that Freyaâ€™s view should prevail. Once again, Persephone was showing very specific preferences that could not realistically have been programmed in.\r\n\r\nFreya searched around for another test. Then she had it. Since the invention of the quantum brain, robots had always been stumped by art and artistic preferences. The villa had been built for Freyaâ€™s great-uncle. It had been decorated with frescoes by an artist, who had been fashionable at the time, but had subsequently become something of a joke in artistic circles. At least, that was until the last few years when she had started to come back into fashion, and Freya had felt obliged to open parts of the villa once a year for members of the society formed by the artistâ€™s his new admirers.\r\nFreya asked Persephone for her opinion of the bathroom frescoes and to say which of the various panels she preferred. At this point, an android would normally fall back on a simple factual catalogue of the subject matter. The android mind never went that further step to give a subjective response. But Persephone admired the light and airy feel of the landscapes, and showed little hesitation in picking out the panels she liked best.\r\n\r\nThen Freya realised that Persephone did indeed share in the rich kaleidoscope of consciousness, from which all previous robot minds had been excluded. She also realised without any closer examination that this device was powerful and dangerous. It was the ultimate Pandoraâ€™s Box. It could lead to very serious trouble. She saw androids running amok, and states and corporations drawn into conflict. And yet, there might be something here for her, something that would allow her to dominate the android industry.\r\n','2011-07-18 20:15:28','2011-07-18 20:15:28'),(1134,96,48,'There appears to be a difference in understanding here about what is meant by consciousness.

But it is at least equally likely that \"unconscious\" processes are not unconscious after all, but merely inaccessible to our central narrative consciousness. For example I don\'t realize I\'ve been getting hungry, but my \"stomach\" has been grousing about it for half an hour before I start paying attention. There are a million such quasi-independent processes going on all the time in our mind, only a small fragment of which become accessible to central consciousness. How often have you suddenly noticed a sound that had been there all along? Some portion of your auditory system had been monitoring it all along, conscious of it independent of your narrative consciousness, until it gets just weird enough that that auditory system \"wakes up\" your narrative consciousness and says \"Listen to this!\" And when you suddenly hear it, you also \"remember\" having been hearing it all along.\r\n\r\nIts all explained here:\r\n\r\nhttp://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/book2/Boundaries.html\r\n\r\nsee Chapter 6, p. 119, section: Is Experience Unitary or Fragmentary?','2011-07-19 19:08:32','2011-07-19 19:08:32'),(1152,96,48,'So much to say!\r\n\r\nslehar: \"There is an assumption that anything that we cannot report being conscious of is an unconscious process.\"\r\n\r\nOh, isn\'t that so true! The assumption disregards the possibility that consciousness takes place but is not memorised and thus cannot be recalled. Think about dreams. We know from brain scans that dreams are far more frequent than dreamers realise, because the dreamers do not remember their dreams. But they still dream!\r\n\r\nIf a rock has awareness but cannot recall it, how does it know? That doesn\'t mean it has no awareness; merely that the awareness is lost as soon as it has happened.

If not then you are right, I am missing the point - sorry. Please could you help me to understand?

Free will arguably requires a component to physics that we do not understand (usually referred to as dualism) but it does not appear to me that consciousness requires anything at all other than an acceptance that matter has awareness as a property. Clearly, physics does produce this much - you are evidence of that. (Alternatively, if we pursue the argument that dualism is required even for consciousness, the claim made that physics is causally closed does not seem to me entirely true.

Of course this is second best to our own first person experience, but it\'s probably the best you can do for a third party.\r\n\r\nYou ask whether preference is evidence for consciousness, and neuroscience of the last few years in effect says yes to that question.\r\n\r\nWhen the orbitofrontal which is important in decision making evaluates the reward/punisher qualities of sensory inputs its activation is  correlated to subjective appreciation rather than the physical strength of the external signal.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean freewill? It certainly points to subjective consciousness influencing decisions and behaviour, although I admit in principle it would seem possible to be conscious but unable to influence events.\r\n\r\nBut no, this is not an argument for dualism. That only arises if we have a Cartesian assumption that consciousness is immaterial. But the problems of dualism suggest that there is no such thing as the immaterial. Consciousness is therefore part of the physical universe, but as such there is no particular reason why it should not have a physical influence on behaviour.\r\n\r\nAs far as dreaming goes, we know at least with REM sleep that significant and energy consuming parts of the brain are at work, and that there\'s nothing analogous to those structures in rock.

Meaning we have both fenomenalogical and psychological counsciousness - the latter is pretty much explained nowadays, our main concern is about the former.\r\n\r\n2) I\'m not sure I believe, but I can accept the pan psychism view - even if that implies infinite conscious beings (even sharing the same body, like conscious bones inside me).\r\n\r\n3) What I cannot accept that we should even consider the hypothesis of fenomenalogical counsciousness being \"existent but irrelevant\" - simply because we (at least, not sure about my bones) are psychologically aware of it. Fenomenalogically, we \"feel\" the psychological processes which result from our brain; but every time we think about that kind of experience, this is our brain generating thougths about the fenomenalogical experience. In other words, the \"spirit\" is aware of the \"mind\"; but the opposite, somehow, is also true.\r\n\r\n4) All this, of course, may be an illusion, and maybe there is no such thing as fenomenalogical experience at all. Still, I insist there is no option for a middle ground: OR fenomenalogical experience exists, and it is also psychologically relevant; OR fenomenalogical experience does NOT exist (and we are all losing our precious time reading this kind of discussion...).\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to appologize for my English.

The experience of one wine as against another, or what\'s probably more important the decision between a short-term benefit and a larger longer-term benefit, say between spending the afternoon drinking, or doing some exercise, which may at a later date give us a healthier body. This is our impression of it, and as of the last few years this is supported by experimentation.\r\n\r\nIt is true as you say that the decision is arbitrary. You can write down pros and cons as much as you like, but the clincher is the subjective scenarios. What we should be asking is where that comes from. As you know, you wouldn\'t be the first to notice that the quantum world can also be a bit arbitrary. \r\n\r\nI wouldn\'t for a moment deny that we are conscious of reasoning, but the evidence suggests that it\'s coloured by emotional processing which lies predominantly up stream of reasoning. Thus reward/punisher valuations are thought to register first in the orbitofrontal and after that in the dorsolateral prefrontal. A mass of medical evidence going all the way back to Phineas Gage shows that damage to the orbitofrontal makes it extremely difficult for patients to make any decision or have acceptable behaviour, although in conversation they are fully cognisant of what they need to do.\r\n\r\nThere is another joker in the pack, upstream of the dorsolateral, and that\'s the amygdala, that relic of our reptile past. The best example here is phobia where the signal by-passes the cortex, to get quickly to the amygdal, and then that\'s a place you really don\'t want to go. If you\'re phobic of snakes say, no amount of reasoning about it not being a non-poisonous variety is going to have any effect.\r\n\r\nTo come back to robots and the robot sensing the wall, I take it that you mean that it\'s like something for the robot to sense the wall. I can\'t disprove that, but is there any evidence for it. When an infra red bea, or whatever bounces of a wall, 1s and 0s and sikicon switches make its limbs or wheels move away from it. That looks to be fully described by classical (I mean macroscopic/non-quantum physics), so why do we need to inject consciousness. Kelvin pointed out more than a century that this type of physics was complete. The extensions to physics came in other kinds.\r\n\r\nReally, I think the problem is more serious than this, because I\'m not sure that this qualifies as a scientific theory. Can you suggest any experiement that would falsify the idea of this robot being conscious? I don\'t think things like the squirming of the alimentary canal are enough because here too classical description which contain no mention of consciousness gives a full explanation. On the other hand what I\'ve said about the orbitofrontal etc could be falsified in a laboratory at any moment, and certainly its very likley to be amended or added to in coming years.\r\n\r\nWhat I said about consciousness and rocks was somewhat self indulgent. The orbitofrontal speaking if you like. I\'d quite like conscious experience to extend down into the inanimate world, but I don\'t see hard evidence, and if there is evidence is likely to involve the quanta and spacetime, and that\'s a hard place, and always subject to what might come out of the Hadron Collider, I think it\'s easier to get there from the brain than the rocks.\r\n\r\nAs a last word, perhaps we should think where we\'re likeley to go if the rocks are conscious. A century ago Freud warned Jung to hold fast to Freudian theory because it was a sluice gate against the dark tide of the occult. How does the theory constrain this world? What comprises a conscious entity in this world? Is it a continuum or is a large rock a single conscious entity, and if that a (sacred) mountain, or the river Nile or Father Tiber, and beyond that the planets, not to speak of the primal manifesting as ghosts and spirits.

On the other those with sufficiently serious damage to ventral are blind for purposes of conscious perception, but can perform this type of action, at least better than chance.\r\n\r\nThese findings relate to the blindsight data where stroke or other damage has destroyed a part but not all of the conscious field.

It\'s not really clear whether this is conscious or unconscious. The basal ganglia are subcortical, but are a sort of mixer tap upstream of action and behaviour, and have feed back to almost everything including the 3D picture in the visual temporal cortex, the dorsolateral (planning) and the orbitofrontal (reward evaluation).\r\n\r\nJunius\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n','2011-08-02 12:07:21','2011-08-02 12:07:21'),(1188,96,48,'>>>>\r\n\r\nThe question really is where you go from there.

In addition to making, or at least moving towards, some of the\r\nrequested improvements, we\'ve also been improving the idea of \'effing\'\r\nof the ineffable which isn\'t described very well in the above version\r\nthat was objected to. \r\n\r\nBasically, there are 3 types of effing. The first weak version is: this\r\ntheory predicts we will be able to reliably know whatever it is that\r\nhas redness in my brain, and be able to objectively observe such in\r\nother\'s brains, (it may be their green) and in this way eff to them my\r\nredness. The problem with this weak way is, if we seek to eff a quale\r\nto a person which has never experienced it before, or if the person\'s\r\nbrain doesn\'t have the required stuff and/or configuration to\r\nexperience it, then some type of brain augmentation is required, to eff\r\nany such new qualia. Any such augmentation of the brain, and then\r\nthrowing the switch to turn it on, to which someone might respond: \'oh\r\nTHAT is what it is like to be a bat\' would be this second type of\r\neffing. Such a demonstration by science would clearly falsify Nagal\'s\r\nfamous assertion that it is impossible to know what it is like to be a\r\nbat, right? \r\n\r\nFinally, there is a 3rd type, the one First Proposed by V.S.\r\nRamachandran, where we connect minds together via \'bundles of neurons\'\r\nand so on, that can do what the corpus callosum can do.... This third\r\ntype is a much stronger type of effing of the ineffable, since it can\r\nconnect minds in such a way that both brains are experiencing the same\r\nwhatever it has that has the same quale. (for an interesting example of\r\nhow minds can be merged, where knowledge of two separate and\r\nindependent spirits can share the same phenomenal knowledge of the\r\nworld space, both seeing out of the other\'s eyes, and so on, see\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWDsXa5nNbI surely they each know what\r\nthe others \'redness\' is like and in fact both experience the same\r\nredness) \r\n\r\nThe first two types of effing, do not provably resolve the\r\nphilosophical \"problem of other minds\", they only move in that\r\ndirection. While the 3rd type of effing, if demonstrated, absolutely\r\nproves and resolves the issue. Such would also absolutely falsify such\r\nphilosophies as idealism, and make it near impossible to rationally\r\nbelieve in most current religious views of spirituality and \'spirits\'\r\nthat consciousness exist independent of a brain... \r\n\r\nSo, anyway, consider this post a validating survey of everyone. If\r\nanyone does not agree that \'Representational Qualia Theory\' predicts\r\nall 3 types of effing will eventually be achieved or demonstrated by\r\nscience, and that demonstrating the 3rd strong type will absolutely\r\nresolve the problem of other minds, absolutely falsify philosophies\r\nlike \'idealism\' and so on, or if you would object to statements\r\ndescribing such being added to the \"Representational Qualia Theory\"\r\ncamp, make sure you speak up. \r\n\r\nBrent Allsop \r\n','2011-08-22 04:29:23','2011-08-22 04:29:23'),(1195,1,37,'\r\n\r\nJohn, \r\n\r\nBrent has encouraged me to post a camp that is quite similar to yours\r\nexcept that the source of the consciousness module is not a brane but\r\nrather the Calabi-Yau Compact Manifold subspace.

Simon pointed out that the original \'classical\' theories were billiard ball\'s bouncing into each other, according to classical laws of physics.  This was turning into a very educational conversation for me.  The idea of thinking of this using classical billiard balls really crystallized many of my thoughts, and I wanted to open this conversation up to the public, here, in hopes of getting more input from everyone.  The following is the way I think about all this, and I\'d like to know what all of you think about thinking of phenomenal properties in this kind of classical billiard ball way.\r\n\r\nSimon mentioned he thought the difference between \"something has qualia\" vs \"qualia arise from something\" as merely \"a bit of a meaning of words thing\".  But I think there is a subtle difference between these that is critically important to clearly understand and fully model.  While talking of redness, Simon said: \"We can certainly agree that the surface of the strawberries don\'t have it.\"  From this he continued on even further with neuronal \"Oscillations in electrical potential do not have redness. Our science gives a full description in that respect.\" and this is where it seems to me things have completely fallen off the track - at least according to the way I currently think of things.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we can both agree that \'redness\' is not a property of the strawberry.  But, we must also acknowledge the very real possibility that the surface of the strawberry does have phenomenal properties.  As far as \"oscillations in electrical potential\", these are abstracted words describing the causal properties of electrical potentials of certain sets of matter.  These words are mere interpretations of what all is really going on and there is a very real possibility that these types of abstracted words are being miss-interpreted when thinking they do not representing something that could have phenomenal properties.  Causal properties of matter are categorically different than phenomenal properties, and this is clearly making the classic mistake of failing to distinguish between the two.  In my mind, it is a very real possibility that this stuff does have phenomenal properties, we are just still blind to these properties, or it would be better to say, we could be simply misinterpreting what these \"oscillation in electrical potential\" are phenomenally like and what all phenomenal properties such might additionally include.\r\n\r\nTo better get at this idea, I\'d like to consider a possibility of how classic billiard balls could have phenomenal properties, and how these properties would be categorically different than their causal properties, and how their phenomenal properties could be miss interpreted.  In this thought experiment, let\'s consider a 3D array of neurons that can each represent or model voxel elements of a 3D volume of space we can see.  Say we have a cube of 1000 X 1000 X 1000 such neurons.  Each of these neurons can communicate with their neighbors and the dendrites of neurons organized in hierarchical layers of neural networks capable of pattern recognition, leading out of the 3D matrix and providing the hierarchical cognitive meaning of what we are seeing.\r\n\r\nLet\'s model this communication interaction as being accomplished by the neurons firing billiard balls at their neighbors, across synapses.  Let\'s pick 2 neurotransmitters at random as example possibilities, such as glutamate and glycine.  Let\'s say our number 1 billiard balls are made of glutamate and number 2 billiard balls are made of glycine.  In this thought experiment when a neuron fires number one billiard balls at its neighbors, the absorption of it is experienced as that voxel element of visual space having the property of redness.  Let\'s say when number 2 billiard balls are fired, we experience a greenness at that location.  The most important part of this \'classical\' system, is that it is just that.  Everything about it, is nothing more than the classical cause and effect operation of synapses we\'ve been observing for the longest time.\r\n\r\nNow, let\'s say we take a bunch of number one billiard balls, and shine some light on them.  Let\'s say the number one balls have a causal property in that they reflect yellow light.  And the number 2 balls causally reflect blue light just like normal 1 and 2 billiard balls that are yellow and blue respectively.  Of course, if we say we know everything, causally, about the number one balls, and claim that redness isn\'t one of their properties, we are obviously completely miss interpreting the causal information we are getting or we are blind to what is most important.  If we say these number one balls have yellowness, simply since they reflect yellow light and we represent their color with yellow knowledge, we are at least getting closer.  Now the only remaining issue required to correctly eff the ineffable, is to get the interpretation right.  Rather than thinking the balls are phenomenally like what we represent them with, we must experiment with, discover and reliably map all this out appropriately, according to how we reliably experience them, so we can properly interpret the number one balls that reflect yellow light as having phenomenal redness, and the number 2 balls that reflect blue light as being experienced as having greenness.\r\n\r\nOf course, phenomenal reality is not anywhere near this simple, just as classical physics is quite a bit more than simple billiard balls bouncing around.  But thinking of classical physics as something like billiard balls bouncing around gives one a powerful intuitive insight into the nature of classical physics.  Similarly, thinking of effing of the ineffable in this simplified classical way, helps one gain an intuitive knowledge of what it might mean to eff, ineffable properties of stuff and how it could be done classically, not requiring any physical weirdness or uncertainty.\r\n\r\nLet\'s get back to the subtle difference of saying things like \"something has qualia\" vs \"qualia arise from something\".  Let\'s also consider similar possible differences between explaining qualia vs discovering qualia.  If you want to \'explain\' how we perceive the strawberry patch, you paint or construct the 3d volume space with things that have phenomenal properties.  This conscious phenomenal knowledge of the strawberry patch arises from, or can be reduced to, the pallet of myriads of individual phenomenal colors and feels we can experienced in our 3d visual knowledge.  But, at the fundamental level, there are irreducible elements that have irreducible phenomenal properties that aren\'t explained and don\'t arise from anything, they are simply the fundamental phenomenal building block properties which can be unified together to produce what consciousness is phenomenally like.  You don\'t explain these fundamental irreducible properties as arising from anything, they simply are to be discovered and most importantly, properly interpreted as such.  Something like this is what you build consciousness out of, and what it can be reduced to.  As long as we consider phenomenal properties as not being among all the causal properties we interpret stuff as having, or thinking they somehow arises from them, we are clearly being blind to and ignoring what they could be phenomenally like.\r\n\r\nSo, what does everyone think?  Is this kind of classic effing thinking worthy of including in Representational Qualia Theory?\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n','2011-09-15 02:56:16','2011-09-15 02:56:16'),(1202,96,48,'Doesn\'t the billard ball analysis belong in the mind-brain identity camp?','2011-09-15 11:33:49','2011-09-15 11:33:49'),(1205,96,48,'The operative thing here is the claim that we are blind to the phenomenal properties of oscillations in electrical potential or possibly the transmission of amino acids between neurons.\r\n\r\nIn looking at this, we need to confront the strengths and weaknesses of classical physics. Its weakness is mainly the failure to yield a theory of consciousness that leaves enquirers generally happy. Its strengths should be seen as something of a wonder in that classical physics plus quanta understood in a more or less classical way explain the behaviour of macroscopic matter in a manner that entirely eluded all previous generations. Because of the very small scale to which more than a century of very exhaustive experimentation has penetrated the chances of finding some classical feature in or attached to electrical oscillations and amino acids is so remote as to be not worth considering. If we are blind to something phenomenal in these then we should admit that we\'re probably looking at something supernatural and learn to live with that.\r\n\r\nThe other thing I would ask is why it\'s so difficult to think about consciousness in terms of the quantum or spacetime levels. I do think this is a cultural problem inflicted on us by mainstream science. The discoveries of quantum theory early in the last century contradicted the concepts of what appeared to be an almost complete classical theory. The response to this was essentially \'don\'t bother your pretty little head with this.\' Quantum theory was marginalised as an abstruse calculation used for certain special cases, whereas the truth was that it described the fundamental nature of matter and energy. Quantum theory was largely excluded from popular knowledge and education even science education. The evil consequence of this was that it gradually seeped out in the late 20th century as a word that could be attached to almost any claim, which in turn allowed the mainstream to ridicule and marginalise the whole area. But the fact is that the theory and its interrelation with spacetime theory are central to understanding our universe.\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2011-09-15 17:03:43','2011-09-15 17:03:43'),(1208,96,48,'\r\nHi John Clem,\r\n\r\nAh, yes, of course.  Now that you remind me, it probably really doesn\'t belong at the Representational Qualia level at all.  Possibly not even at the mind brain identity theory?

I would reply that it is not.  In my mind, It is definitely a very real possibility, and one of the only camps I think is not yet completely falsified.  After all, I am also a supporter of the Orch OR camp, secondarily, after my current Macro Property Dualism first choice (probably where the billiard ball stuff goes?).\r\n\r\nJunious, how can we best capture our differences of beliefs, and get this canonized or represented in both of our camps, so we can rigorously measure for how many people, if any, agree with either of us?\r\n\r\nI think it should be very clearly represented, that we both agree that quantum is a very real possibility, and I understand at least some of the good arguments that support this view.\r\n\r\nJunius, you say: \"Its weakness is mainly the failure to yield a theory of consciousness that leaves enquirers generally happy.\"  I disagree with this, and think this is the primary disagreement?  I see a very real possibility that classical stuff, in addition to having the regular classical cause and effect behavioral properties, could also have phenomenal properties.  Our perception process can even see this, it\'s just that we are still obviously miss interpreting what they are phenomenally like, as described when we think the number one billiard ball is like \'yellowness\' just because we interpret it as being yellow, and represent it with such.  When in reality it is like redness.\r\n\r\nI also think you are making a mistake when you say: \"If we are blind to something phenomenal in these then we should admit that we\'re probably looking at something supernatural and learn to live with that.\"\r\n\r\nEven if there is some magic or spark, down at the quantum level, you will still eternally be faced with the same identical problem, no matter how quantumly deep and mystical it becomes.  Causally, you\'ll be able to observe the spark, randomness, or whatever, but you could still be miss interpreting that spark\'s causal properties as yellowness, when it is really redness, right?\r\n\r\nIf science demonstrably proves anything like the billiard ball simplification, and achieves the ability to eff the true nature of whatever classical, or quantum stuff it is in our brain that has redness, and so on, then it will completely falsify your theory right?  And anyone that once would consider themselves as not satisfied with any such explanation, must then be completely satisfied in the Billiard Ball camp, once they experience for themselves, what it is like, and they know how  to properly interpret what they are causally observing, right?\r\n\r\nThanks for all the conversations, everyone.

The reference to billiard balls is simply a widely used image for how classical physics works. It also neatly contains the idea of a complete explanation for the behaviour of macroscopic objects. The purpose of science is to explain behaviour in the universe and in respect of the macroscopic world, classical physics is completely succesful. As Laplace, I think, is supposed to said to Napoleon, there was no place for the concept of a God. Any addition to the properties of classical/billiard ball type particles puts one completely outside of science. In classical physics, you can run but you can\'t hide. This is the reason that the serried ranks of biologists, neuroscientists and reductionist philosophers think they can be so dismissive of consciousness.

We\'ve been attending conferences, finding and interviewing experts in this field so that we might \'canonize\' their views to measure and build as much consensus as possible around the best theories as part of the Consciousness Survey Project.  The current body of \"peer reviewed\" work, and other surveys, seems to do nothing but confirm everyone\'s pervasive beliefs that there is no expert consensus in this field whatsoever.  As everyone knows everyone regularly mocks the field, and its complete lack of any significant results as mere \"philosophies of men\".  However, the consensus building, amplification of the wisdom of the crowd open survey system at canonizer.com might be about to falsify this pervasive belief that consciousness is so \"hard\" and that it is only almost approachable via a very few super brains.  The dramatic early consensus emerging and extending its lead seems to be indicating there may already be a huge amount of agreement on a great many fairly simple things, in this theoretical field of science, after all.\r\n\r\nFor the last 6 months, the participating experts in the consensus camp have been collaboratively developing and negotiating a new version of the camp statement concisely describing what most of the experts appear to already agree on.  It\'s not easy getting this much consensus from this many diverse experts, such has never been achieved in the past, but it is now being proved possible if you have the right techniques, such as the ability to push lesser important disagreeable ideas out of the way, into sub camps, instead of exclusively focusing only on them.  This new super camp statement, after months of negotiation, finally just recently made it through the unanimous canonization review process.  In addition to answering the question of where redness is located  (It is not a property of the strawberry, but of our knowledge of it)  it includes the description of the \"Quale Interpretation Problem\" which is a technical description of why ineffable properties are blind to traditional cause and effect observation.  It also includes predictions of various possible ways scientists will be able to get around this problem to \'eff\' these ineffable properties and finally resolve the many long standing issues such as \"the problem of other minds\"\', \"what it is like to be a bat\", possibly even falsifying \"Idealism\", \"Solipsism\", \"Skepticism\", and so on. (see the early consensus camp at: http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6 )\r\n\r\nThe highest top super camp in the main survey topic addresses whether or not consciousness is approachable via science.  So far, about 29 of the 35 participants are in this super camp with only a few brave souls willing to put their reputation on the line and support competing camps such as: \"Consciousness is of Divine Origin and Unfathomable Apart from God\".\r\n\r\nAt the next level down, very surprisingly, with almost as much consensus, is the recently named \"Representational Qualia Theory\" camp.  When we first started this survey, we thought there would be many significant competitors to this camp such as simple \"Computational Functionalism\", \"we don\'t have qualia, it just seems like we do\", \"idealism\", \"you can\'t eff the ineffable\"  and so on.  At least, that is what the wikipedia article on qualia (falsely?) leads one to believe.  Despite our continued best efforts to recruit experts to support any such competing camps, and make the survey more comprehensive, it is surprising how it seems that so far nobody is willing to stand up and make any effort to support any of them at anywhere near the rate, compared to the many emerging experts which are already so willing to support this new qualophile \"Representational Qualia Theory\".\r\n\r\nThe early consensus seems to be indicating there is significant consensus about WHERE redness, and all the other phenomenal properties consciousness is composed of are located.  The only remaining yet to be falsified issue, at least for the experts appear to be the WHATs and HOWs of redness.  At the sub camp levels below this consensus camp, some dramatic theories are forming about these WHATs and HOWs.  The best of them are making obviously falsifiable predictions about just what science is about to discover and how it will validate each theory to the falsification of all competitors.\r\n\r\nThe clear consensus continues at the next sub level with the Mind-Brain Identity theory camp leading against some significant competitors such as Higher-dimension Theories (including the Smythies Carr Hypothosis) and Panexperientialism.\r\n\r\nAt the next level down the current consensus is far less clear and far more dramatic.  The early and still holding on to its lead camp is the one led by David Chalmers, or \"Functional Property Dualism\".  Its principle doctrine is Chalmers\' \"Invariance Principle\" which holds that the same quale can \"arise\"  in some \"hard\" way from any equivalent functional isomorph, from silicon to neurons, or anything that can do Turing computation.  This theory is basically falsifiably predicting you will be able to reliably know when you are observing redness when you observe the right functionality.\r\n\r\nBut a rapidly gaining camp appears to be on the verge of overtaking this consensus camp at this sub level.  This is the \"Material Property Dualism\" camp which basically predicts that redness is simply a property of some material in the brain.  It predicts that without this right stuff which has these phenomenal properties, you can\'t have redness.  And if you observe the right stuff, in the right neural correlate state, you will reliably know, in an effing way, what the person is experiencing.\r\n\r\nThis emerging camp further breaks down into the newest to be canonized and obviously very popular sub \"Orchestrated Object Reduction\" camp lead by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose.  The lesser competitor is \"Macro Property Dualism\" which predicts phenomenal properties can just as easily be a property of any classical object, possibly some kind of standing wave of neural firing, even possibly a set of classical bouncing \'billiard balls\', and that no quantum weirdness or any magic is required to discover or eff the ineffable.  All that is required is proper communication, and thinking about it in the right way, to know what where and how to look for it.\r\n\r\nOf course, we continue to seek to make the survey more comprehensive in the open survey wiki way.  Whether you are an expert (see: http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/53/11 ) or not, we seek to measure and compare it all.  Even high school students have been making significant contributions to this amplification of the wisdom of the crowd process.  Perhaps there is a much better way to organize the existing structure?  If so, it can all be accommodated, according to the will of the scientific consensus.  So if you feel there is a justified theory that could turn out to be the one validated by science, please help us get such \'canonized\' for the benefit of everyone.  There are volunteers ready to help integrate, or canonize your ideas into what has already been built.  Help us sooner get to what could turn out to be the greatest scientific achievement of all time:  The demonstrable discovery and agreement of what, where, and how the conscious mind is.\r\n\r\nAs always, our goal is to rigorously capture and measure, in real time, when the demonstrable science validates the one theory and falsifies all others.  When this revolution does take place, we hope to be able to see it very definitively and undeniably, here, as the experts start to abandon the finally falsified camps.  It appears that at least at some level, this could have already started in a revolutionary and dramatic way, likely in a more dramatic way than when we finally switched from a geocentric solar system view.\r\n\r\n','2011-10-12 05:05:52','2011-10-12 05:05:52'),(1225,96,48,'\r\nTheoreticians,\r\n\r\nI\'m preparing an abstract for submission to next year\'s Towards a Science of Consciousness conference.

We are using the all volunteer driven, crowd sourced wiki with camps based bottom up survey system being developed at canonizer.com.  The primary survey topic being \"Theories of mind and Consciousness\" (see: http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88 ).\r\n\r\nThe diverse set of current publications, and previous attempts at surveys to date, all seem to support the pervasive belief that there is no expert consensus on much of anything in this field.  While the results with the Consciousness Survey Project are still far from comprehensive, there already appears that there could be a significant amount of consensus, after all, on a great many things in this field.  To date no consensus statement has been possible where this many diverse experts have signed on as unanimously agreeing to it.\r\n\r\nThe current consensus clearly indicates the most fundamental issue is whether consciousness is approachable via science or not.  Currently, about 32 of the 35 participators agree that it is.  At the next level down, shockingly, there is almost as much consensus around what the experts recently unanimously agreed to call \"Representational Qualia Theory\".  There is obviously clear expert consensus on many issues concisely stated at this level such as where redness is located (not on the surface of the strawberry) and about the \"Quale Interpretation Problem\" describing why redness is ineffable and predictions of how this problem can be overcome.  Below this are various competing theories about just what redness is including the leading \"Mind-Brain Identity\" camp.  Finally at this level some significantly supported competing camps start to appear such as \"Higher-dimensional Theories\" and \"Panexperientialism\".\r\n\r\nThings start to get very interesting at the next level down, where David Chalmers\' \"Functional Property Dualism\" started out with a significant lead, but there is a clear contender, quickly emerging and appears on the verge of overtaking the consensus at this level.  This is the \"Material Property Dualism\" camp.  Where Chalmers predicts if you have the right \'functionality\', regardless of if it is neurons or computer chips, you will get redness, Material Property dualists are predicting the right material is what has redness, and without it, no redness.\r\n\r\nThis emerging camp includes Hameroff\'s Orch OR theory, which predicts some quantum magic is required to experience redness and a lessor camp which predicts phenomenal properties can just as easily be a property of any classical non quantum object, possibly some kind of standing wave of neural firing, even possibly a set of classical bouncing \'billiard balls\', and that no quantum weirdness is required to eff the ineffable.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to continue this survey and expand it to include all leading experts and theories in this field, and to track this till science falsifies all but the one theory, forcing all the experts to abandon and join that one theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n','2011-10-29 21:56:56','2011-10-29 21:56:56'),(1228,96,48,'By all means include my name as interested/involved etc. I\'m unlikley to make the conference until such time as its back in Europe as I have an aversion to both the cost and experience of long haul travel.

It has been very productive and has helped my clean up many of the messy thinking arguments that I often use to support Material Property Dualism.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that James\' argument as to why Software = Qualia is simply that the brain is a computer, and everything in it can simulated to any desired degree of accuracy, with any sufficient abstracted, ones and zeros based system.  (James, let us know if I haven\'t adequately described your position.)\r\n\r\nI completely agree with this assertion, but am attempting to point out that this is entirely missing what ineffable phenomenal properties are, that can also be represented by enough ones and zeroes, but only if you properly interpret the appropriate set of ones and zeros as the redness and the greenness that they represent - and that - by design, such ones and zeros aren\'t like anything, they are just interpretations of anything, no matter what the ones and zeros are represented with.\r\n\r\nIn another attempt to better communicate to him what I\'m trying to say, I\'ve adapted the phenomenal billiard ball system I described in the previously discussed [http://canonizer.com/thread.asp/88/1/24 Effing Billard Balls] thread to be a design for a phenomenal strawberry picking robot.\r\n\r\nIn the other forum, we seemed to be the only two people interested in our debate, so we both wanted to find out what others thought about who was winning this debate, so I decided to move the conversation here.  If any of you are interested in indicating what you do or don\'t believe, and why, we\'d love to hear from you.\r\n\r\nMy main questions to anyone in the Software = Qualia camp would be:  Would you agree that if science turned out to be just like the predictions made by the below theoretically possible world, you\'d have to assume Functional Property Dualism was false and abandon your camp as being falsified.\r\n\r\nAlso, in this theoretically possible reality it is simply the neural transmitters that have, in addition to all their other causal properties, also have some ineffable phenomenal properties that can be experienced.  So this is where the redness and greenness come from in this theoretically possible reality, and how they are discovered, and so on.  My question to Software = Qualia people is what type of set of ones and zeros might correspond with, or cause something like redness to emerge?  And how might you \'discover\' new phenomenal properties, and what would dictate what these new properties would be like, would there be any kind of limit to the set of phenomenal properties that could be experienced or discovered, and so on?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=============\r\n\r\n\'\'\'Mechanical description of a theoretically possible phenomenal strawberry picking robot.\'\'\'\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this robot is to pick red strawberries from a field of green leaves.  There are traditional digital cameras for perception, and traditional, digitally controlled arms that can receive digital commands to move to a particular location, then grasp and pick any strawberry that is at that location.\r\n\r\nWe will assume that in this theoretically possible reality, there are two different neural transmitters that, in addition to behaving identically to the actual ones in this world, also have phenomenal properties.  Glutamate having a redness property, and Aspartate having a greenness property.  If you shine light on them, common Glutamate in crystalline form, reflects white light, and Aspartate reflects gray, just like the real stuff in this world.  It is possible in this reality to create neuron like mechanism with Axon terminals, that can emit these two neurotransmitters and Dendrites with receptors that can uptake them.\r\n\r\nThe brain of this system has a 1K x 1K x 1K 3D array of these neuron like structures.  The cameras are wired up to a perception system that feeds into this 3D array of neurons.  When the cameras are pointing to a patch in the strawberry field, it causes a set of neurons in this volume, in the shape of the strawberries and levees, to fire.  When any of these neurons are stimulated by the perception system indicating there is the surface of a strawberry at the corresponding location in the field of the camera, it fires Glutamate across all of its Axon terminals.  When the perception system detect the surface of a green leaf at that same location, the axon terminals fire Aspartate.\r\n\r\nThere is a hierarchical neuronal structured this entire 3D volume of neurons feeds into capable of recognizing not only the red strawberries and the green leaves, but is also self aware of the fact that its redness and greenness are phenomenally experienced very different from each other.  It is the phenomenal difference between the redness of the Glutamate and the Greenness of the Aspartate, that enable the system to know where the strawberries are, and where to direct the hand to pick them.  The system interprets the redness as representing what it wants to pick, and the greenness as representing what should be avoided.  It also has a voice system, such that if something asks what color is the item at a particular location, it has enough intelligence such that it can answer red, if the neurons at that location are firing Glutamate, and it will answer Green, if the neurons are firing Aspartate.\r\n\r\nIn this particular reality, you can completely simulate everything this computer does with a simple binary system.  You can have a 3 dimensional 1K by 1K by 1K array of values that can hold a binary 0 when there is green at that location, and a binary one, when there is a strawberry.  When you ask it what color something is, it behaves identically, saying the strawberries are red, and the leaves are green.  But of course, this system is designed not to matter what represents red or green, as long as the downstream controlling system selecting what to pick, interprets whatever is dong the representation, appropriately.  Anything that is represented by something interpreted as one is also interpreted as what should be picked.\r\n\r\nNow, this particular theoretically possible reality, is just as described by Material Property Dualism.  There is nothing in it, except the Glutamate, that has the redness that can be experienced.  If you replace any of the 3D volume of knowledge neurons with something else, if there is no Glutamate involved, the robot experiences nothing like redness for the particular location that that neurons represents in the visible space.\r\n\r\nLet\'s say there was a 3rd neurotransmitter in this world that had a blueness phenomenal property - say Dopamine.  You go into this 3D volume of neurons, and replace a set of them with this different neuron that fires with Dopamine, when there is a strawberry, instead of the Glutamate.  And let\'s say the recognition system has no words for this new blueness color.  When you ask the system what color is at that location, it says I see a strawberry there, but it is not like any of the other red strawberries, nor any of the green leaves.  I don\'t know what color that is.  But, if you want me to pick it, I can.\r\n\r\n','2011-11-18 04:36:55','2011-11-18 04:36:55'),(1258,96,48,'Theoreticians,\r\n\r\nI\'d like to welcome Joshua DeZarn (AKA [http://canonizer.com/support_list.asp?nick_name_id=248 change84]) as the newest supporter in this topic.

So I figured I could try to describe to him how I might create or simulate a \"Functionalist Property Dualism\" world within a basement world that adheres to the rules of Material Property Dualism.  I noticed that imagining such simulations, that operate within a basement world that behaves according to the rules predicted by Material Property Dualism, is the way I try to think of other theories, so I thought this might be a good way to improve communication between two people like us with very different working theories.\r\n\r\nSo, James, let\'s start in a basement world that follows the rules of Material Property Dualism, and within that world, let me attempt to create a simulation of a world that follows Functional Property Dualism rules, as I currently believe you imagine them to be.\r\n\r\nWe want to do what would be required to build a similar phenomenal strawberry picking device to the one described above.  But, since this one would be in a simulated FPD world, we want to describe the differences.\r\n\r\nThe previous robot had a 1K x 1K x 1K 3D array of neuron like structures which, if these neurons fired Glutamate in their downstream synapses, it would experience a redness quale at that voxel location, while if it fired Aspartate, it would experience greenness at that voxel location, since it was the Glutamate and Aspartate that had these redness and greenness phenomenal properties.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is argued that in the FPD world, a string of bits could produce a redness quale experience.  So let\'s say that we design this simulation to have, instead of a 3D array of neurons firing either glutamate or Aspartate, there are simply abstract string arrays that can contain a simple string value formatted as: \"Magic:0xRRGGBB\", where RR is a hex value from 00 to FF representing the level of redness color, and GG, and BB are the same for greenness and blueness.\r\n\r\nJames admits he\'s not sure how any set of ones and zeros could result in an experience of a redness quale, he just claims he has proven it must be so.  But in a simulated world you can alter the rules any way you want to make any theoretically possible reality.  So that is exactly what we wire into this simulated FPD world.  Since this simulated FPD world is running within a MPD world, it follows the assumption that you can\'t get something from nothing.  In other words, just as you can\'t store information, without having something physical to represent it with, you can\'t have a phenomenal property, without something that has the phenomenal property.  So, in order to have something that can experience a redness quale in the simulated FPD world, some additional stuff needs to be added to the simulation, to match up a string like \"Magic:0xFF0000\" that exists in the simulation, and wire in a real set of neurons in the basement world that fire Glutamate resulting in the redness quale experience that we need to exist in this FPD world.  We do it in a way so that no matter what is representing the string \"Magic:0xFF0000\", whether it is simulated silicon, or simulated neurons, or even bear cans, the simulation hardware detects this \"Magic:0xFF0000\" string, and harness a set of neurons firing glutamate in the basement world, producing a true redness quale experience in the simulated world.\r\n\r\nNow, letâ€™s say there are two brains running in this functional property dualism world.  They both propose two theories as to the way their world is operating and what is responsible for their phenomenal redness and greenness experiences.  One proposes Material Property Dualism â€“ predicting the only way to get redness, is to have the right matter.  He predicts that silicone can\'t have a redness property.  The other is predicting functional property dualism, that anything that has the correct set of ones and zeros, will result in the redness quale experience they are both capable of experiencing.\r\n\r\nSo, they take their instruments, and start probing the makeup of these simulated brains and examining just how it is they work.  Of course as predicted by the functional property dualists, they discover that any time they see the abstract string of â€œmagic:0xFF0000â€, the brain experiences a point of redness qualia experience.  This happens no matter what part of the brain it is working on, and no matter what that part of the brain is representing that string with â€“ anything from a paper tape with the right bits on it, to a set of magnetic characters represented by bits of properly oriented ferrous material, and so on â€“ will all produce a spot of redness quale experience (thanks to the magic wired into this simulated world).\r\n\r\nSo, the brain predicting Functional Property Dualism shows to the other brain, this objective, demonstrate-able to both discovery, and says: I told you so, our world is a functional property dualist world.  And the Material Property Dualist brain admits, yes, you are definitely right, I was wrong.  I thought it would require effing magic, to achieve this, but low and behold, that is just what we see in reality, apparent effing magic, for any time we have a string like \"Magic:0xFF0000\", no matter what is being interpreted as representing that string.  Who, but you, could have thought such?\r\n\r\nAnd the mistaken brain then abandonâ€™s the material property dualist camp, and starts supporting the functional property dualistâ€™s camp, and very much enjoys finally effing all his experiences with everyone else\'s brain, in their newly enhanced effing brains and finally grounded abstract communications.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is, does such a simulated FPD world, work the way you are predicting our world operates, in a FPD way?  If not why and how must it be different?  And of course, if it is different, can you describe how you might do the reverse, and simulate a MPD world, where the MPD brain can be the one that turns out to be right?  All so that I might better understand with more completeness, just what it is you understand the set of FPD rules to be?\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n','2011-12-13 04:14:31','2011-12-13 04:14:31'),(1262,1,64,'Hi Damir,\r\n\r\nYou proposed adding the \"I suggest we merge this camp...\" to the agreement statement.\r\n\r\nThings like this belong in the camp forums, so I\'m going to object to that proposed change, which will prevent it from going live.\r\n\r\nI do completely agree that we need to merge these two topics.

It was a result of negotiations between Hellenistic and Jewish scholars with a variety of Christian traditions --- almost four centuries after Christ. In essence, Constantine the Great needed the highest authority possible to rule over his crumbling empire.\r\n\r\nBack then, rulers were expected to have backing of unnatural authority --- the more powerful the better... Naturally, a god above all other gods was the best option. Nonchristian religions were also trying to provide such moral authority to their own one and only god.

However, they are still stuck in the past --- polytheistic past of the Roman Empire. Therefore, all theological attempts to reconcile these religions are doomed to fail.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that it is time to forget about such one and only god in a pantheon --- and then work on the possible future elections about whose god should be on the throne to rule over the universe.\r\n\r\nIt is also my opinion that The Protestor intuited the new age coming. They simply had a hope awaken --- a hope that we really have free will. And with this hope, entirely new morality comes in as a surprising factor. It is now hard to delegate our free will to civil authorities and then forget about it. I expect to see something similar in religions also.

I\'ve taken some liberties with this new camp which I think are important, so I hope you\'ll all review these before I make these changes in the next few days.\r\n\r\nIn the new statement I specifically define qualia or a phenomenal property to be that which cannot be communicated by abstract representations, or software, alone.  I know there are some supporters of Functional Property Dualism that are also in the [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/83/3 \"software = qualia\"] camp, so I\'m assuming you must disagree with this definition that says qualia cannot be software, alone.\r\n\r\nI think it is very confusing to people (especially me) who want to know, concisely and quantitatively, what everyone believes, to try to keep their head around the idea that some property dualists believe qualia = software, and there are some that don\'t.  I think this is a critically important issue, when dealing with consciousness, so I think this should be dealt with very high in the POV hierarchy.  In other words, it is my opinion, that everyone would have a much better time understanding what we all believe, if people that think software = qualia, recreate a new parallel branch, to what we have now, under the \"property dualism\" branch.\r\n\r\nOn big implication of this is it will split the [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/17 Mind Brain Identity camp] across two POV branches.   Obviously, the consensus camp under \"Property Dualism\" is for \"Mind Brain Identity\".  I\'m assuming there will be a similar consensus camp under the new \"Representational Functionalism\" camp, if identity theory is not unanimously accepted by all of \"Representational Functionalists\" and there by contained in the new \"Representational Functionalism\" camp itself.  I think it is important that each identity camp point to the other, so if people want to know how many \"mind brain identity\" people there are, they need to count up both camps.  They just need to know that some are on the \"property dualists\" branch and some are not.\r\n\r\nIf, in the future, we discover that there are far more mind brain identity theoriests, than property dualists, this could bring about a theoretical revolution in that we move \"mind brain identity\" theory branch higher in the POV structure than property dualism branch.  This would fork property dualism on these two identity branches instead.  But, for the time being, there are far more spiritual property dualists, so I believe the consensus is that the highest level split, for now, remain with property dualism.\r\n\r\nI haven\'t yet seen how the new \"representational functionalism\" will turn out, but have a few ideas about what James plans on including in it, including the doctrine that software = qualia?  I would hope that everyone that does think that software = qualia will help him to come up with a concise and quantitative representation of what you all believe.  Or, if anyone has any better ideas, we\'re surely open to all such.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, I plan on moving all the old children to RQT to have this new [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/19 \"Property Dualism\"] camp.  So in other words, if anyone remains in those camps that move, it will imply that you now agree with the definition of qualia that says it can\'t = software, alone.\r\n\r\nAgain, as always, if I\'m missing anything, or if anyone has any better ideas, or objects to any of this, please do so here, before we continue making these efforts, so we can find the best way to get what works for everyone, and so we can best represent, concisely and quantitatively, to the rest of the world, what we all believe.\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop','2012-03-18 21:17:18','2012-03-18 21:17:18'),(1294,1,92,'There is a new sub camp in the public sex education camp, called the \"Combination Sex Ed Best\" camp.

Many experts want to join multiple camps (I would want to do this in this case, like Mike), and want to provide much more specific definitions of what they mean, and so on, when they did or didn\'t select a particular answer from any limited set.  Primitive surveys like that are completely worthless.  Everyone just argues over what experts really meant when they did or didn\'t check any of the check boxes, so you can\'t use it to convince anyone of anything, or to show any kind of consensus of any value, since anyone can believe anything they want about what any experts meant when they did or didn\'t check any particular box.  I\'ve experienced this with people many times.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, I was hoping that moving this illusion doctrine into the compatible camp would include being more specific about definitions.  For example, it must be explicit that the kind of free will already defined in the camp (getting that which is better) is not an illusion.\r\n\r\nI was hoping to also specify a different kind of free will than that, something like it \'seems\' like some unitary \"we\" has all the power over the choice, and that there is no deterministic or programmed causes and effects, in some kind of indefinable and mysteriously culpable way.  I think everyone in the compatible camp would agree with such, if the definitions were concisely specified in the right way.\r\n\r\nAlso, I see evidence of you and most other people of thinking of Canonizer.com like a traditional survey in this and other ways, in other topics.  This is completely the wrong way to think about it.  Everyone should be working, as much as possible, to have the fewest possible camps.\r\n\r\nThe goal of everyone, should be to have just one, easy for everyone to read, if not a single supper camp, that includes all doctrines agreed on by everyone, then having it all in the \'agreement statement\' at the root.  Any time there are differences of opinion such that it requires multiple camps, it should be specified exactly what would be required, or why anyone cannot be a part of competing camps, including lack of experimental evidence, or whatever.  This to explain to experimentalists, what will be required, to win over everyone else, and so on.  Primitive surveys are static, where Canonizer.com is meant to constantly improve, and increase the amount of consensus, especially about any natural sciences, or predictions about such.\r\n\r\nIn many places, people have created way to many lonely camps, containing doctrines that many, if not most of the people in existing camps, would completely agree with.  It is far better to assume you can improve an existing camp with more consensus, even if it appears to be significantly different,  to be what you want it to be.  There is a good chance that someone just started an existing camp, quickly, off the top of their head, and that they really wanted it to be like what you\'d also like it to be.  Only fork or create a new camp when it finally becomes clear that there is no way to achieve all \"the improvements\", you\'d like to see.\r\n\r\nWhen I\'ve talked like this before, you\'ve pointed out that diversity of  opinion isn\'t a bad thing.  And I completely agree.  In many still theoretical things, diversity of opinion is a good thing.  We desperately need to have real motivated people to cover all possible bases, and to know who these people are.

Here is a summary of these changes.\r\n\r\nJames Carroll and Mike Gashler, once supporters of the Functional Property Dualism camp, noticed that the â€œProperty Dualismâ€ doctrine, as it was defined and contained in the Representational Qualia Theory camp statement â€“ is problematic.  Basically, they are not â€˜property dualistsâ€™.\r\n\r\nSo, we pushed this doctrine out of the Representational Qualia Theory camp statement, into a new sub camp named [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/19  â€œProperty Dualismâ€].  Then James and Mike created the new competing sub camp [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/18 Representational Functionalism].\r\n\r\nA big part of this misunderstanding has to do with less than clear definitions of â€œQualiaâ€, and â€œPhenomenal propertiesâ€ and I think lack of clear definitions of what people do and don\'t mean by these terms is the cause of significant problems in this field.  Obviously, some people think of these terms in very different ways than others, making communication impossible.\r\n\r\nI believe property dualists think of these things as follows:\r\n\r\nThe term â€˜qualeâ€™ and â€˜phenomenal propertyâ€™ are synonyms.  They refer to \'ineffable\' properties of nature which suffer from the quale interpretation problem, as currently defined in the RQT statement.  If you don\'t know how to properly interpret an abstract word like \'salty\', you can\'t know what it means, or what it is like for a specific person.  That is what \'ineffable\' means.\r\n\r\nThe current Property Dualism statement defines quale and since it is a synonym, a phenomenal property to be \"that which cannot be communicated by abstract information alone, without knowing how to properly interpret the representations.\"  So, by definition, people that believe quale can arise from software, are talking about something very different than this.\r\n\r\nThe proposed statement for the new competing [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/18 Representational Functionalism] camp (scheduled to go live This Fri - set the as of value to review to see before then) states:  \"we deny the existence of any \'phenomenal\' properties such as are claimed by the property dualists\"\r\n\r\nWhich is obviously threatening the liberal usage of this term \"phenomenal properties\" in the current RQT statement.  This is threatening because if this is really true, this is something else that needs to be removed from the RQT camp, along with Property Dualism.\r\n\r\nSo, my question to the new anti \"property dualists\", or supporters of the new \"Representational Functionalist\" camp is: can we come up with any definition of this word \'phenomenal\' which we can all agree on, so that we can continue to use it in RQT, and so on.\r\n\r\nObviously, you are happy using the term \'qualia\', so if you assume \'phenomenal property\' is the exact same thing, how is this a problem?  What is it, beyond qualia, that you think \'phenomenal property\' means, that you object to?\r\n\r\nAlso, when we are talking to \"Representational Functionalists\", what terminology can we use, to describe \'ineffable\' properties?  And what does the term \'ineffable\' mean to you, when we say to you quale are ineffable?

By focusing the ineffability of qualia, the debate is framed in a way which privileges representation and communication over first hand experience from the start. My own understanding is that the privacy of qualia is an ontological conjugate to the public topologies of quanta. The fact of its privacy is important but incidental compared to the visceral, concrete experiential content of qualia themselves.\r\n\r\nTo re-present something - whether it is the optical reflection of an orange tree, or a complex neurological computation which digitally maps to an analog of that reflection, requires that it is being represented by something else. That something else could be called a sensorimotive presentation, a sensation, perception, feeling, qualia, experience, etc. \r\n\r\nThe problem with such a presentation layer is that it doesn\'t make any sense if we come to it from an assumption of mechanism. There is no possible advantage for such a redundant epiphenomenon to be developed, let alone any possible mechanism by which literal phenomena can re-present themselves as anything other than what they are. Were we not inundated with these perceptions constantly ourselves, we could have no inkling that such a thing could exist.\r\n\r\nHow then to come to an agreement between the steam roller of RQT functionalism and the hot house flower of the essence of subjectivity? You can\'t. They are mutually exclusive. The whole point of RQT is to de-present qualia and qualia is nothing but the presentation of sense.

To an ant, the bark of the tree is geography or real estate, but the tree as a whole probably has no properties other than maybe a feeling of its shade and aromatic qualities.\r\n\r\nThere are levels in which the entire tree responds as a single organism, levels where it responds as a part of a forest, a climate, or biosphere, and levels where the tree is lost in a microcosm of cells and molecules. All of these levels overlap and make sense in different contexts. They can interact in series and in parallel.\r\n\r\nIs the orange tree a set of quantitative measurements and forms which are in theory independent from all forms of observation, or is it the sum or all possible sense presentations from all perspectives for all time? Is an orange seed an orange tree? Is the DNA of an orange tree an orange tree? Can an orange tree really be defined without bringing in the whole history of Mesozoic Era flora on Earth?\r\n\r\nI know it\'s crazy but I think that answer may be something like \'an orange tree\' is an inertial bundle of perturbations in the totality of the cosmos. \r\n\r\nA perturbation of the Totality diffracts through though itself, so that whatever observer (itself a perturbation in the totality) receives a properties of the orange tree\'s perceptual inertia in the form of a diffraction with the observer\'s own perceptual inertia. The diffraction of subject and object is sense, and it recapitulates phenomenologically the net difference and similarity between the two. \r\n\r\nThe similarity is perceived as augmented phases or sequences of sense (significance, experience, and ultimately \'time\') and the difference cannot be perceived directly but must be measured indirectly as mechanism (evolution, entropy, and ultimately \'space\').\r\n\r\nOn the exterior, I model it like a pyramid or ziggurat that is a stack of a particular ranges of frequencies, scales, forms, mechanisms, and relations which persist in such a way that the observer sees what is beneath them as being more of a machine which \'simply is\' while the forms closest to the self (in size, frequency, character) are increasingly open to \'seems like\' interpretation. Dualism is literally in the eye of the beholder, as the further one looks away from oneself, the more subjective identification decoheres.\r\n\r\nOn the interior, it is more like Indra\'s Net. Still a hierarchy of interior conjugates to the external frames (a group of cells might make us sense something, a few groups of cells might make us \'feel\' something, etc... it scales up as qualitative depth and richness of perception) but instead of having its roots in existential forms and objects divided across space, the interior has its roots in the Totality/Singularity. Think of the T/S like a Terminal Server. Each identity gets its own profile which is generic in some sense and open to unique customization in another. The TS itself is the hub of spacetime, and all events within spacetime occur, on the most primordial level, in a single \'now\' that spans the entire continuum from the instantaneous to the eternal. Causality and time arise as experiences of perturbations within the TS.\r\n\r\nWhen we see an orange tree then, we are seeing a little holographic slice, our human-hominid-animal-Earthling flavored slice of what the tree means, how it makes sense with the rest of the cosmos from your vantage point. Its qualitative properties are instructive not only about what the tree is good for to us evolutionarily (in a compressed, subconscious way - fruit looks, smells, and tastes, like something we want to eat to survive) but the whole presentation reveals perception itself. The symmetries and metaphors, the organic aesthetic principles, the cycle of seed-plant-tree-fruit-seed... it\'s all TS bootstrap code to help us orient ourselves and reflect back to us both who we are and where we are.\r\n\r\n>Will it ever be possible to \'eff\' the ineffable, as in to find out if\r\n>my redness is anything like your redness, or perhaps like your\r\n>greenness, or maybe even something like you\'ve never experienced before\r\n>in your life?\r\n\r\nThere may be an easier way, but for now the only way I can think of is to surgically merge our brain with another brain or with a more universal merging appliance. There are brain conjoined twins who already share minds, so it would just be a matter of technology and ethics to allow us to extend that across a digital network.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say we can\'t record or produce full sensory movies that can give us an experience of virtual reality that extends to making changes in who we feel like we are. Its hard to guess to what extent a feelie-movie produced for a general audience would translate into our individual hardware (different brain, different diffraction of sense) so I don\'t anticipate that a baby can become a full grown adult by watching a two hour brain movie (although re-releasing A Clockwork Orange in 10-D qualia might come close).\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the thing with qualia is that even though it is private by definition (because it is the unification-seeking \'time\' ontology which is symmetric to the fragmentation-entropy \'space\' topology that is by definition public), it can be shared. Intimacy, expression, art, music, culture...all of civilization would be a blank slate if we could easily match each others inner states exactly. It\'s the obstacle, the diffraction that brings out sense and motive to bridge the gap.\r\n\r\nCraig','2012-04-03 13:42:12','2012-04-03 13:42:12'),(1323,96,48,'James and I have put together a statement that we think may represent what all supporters of RQT have in common. We have tried to throw out the phrases that have been creating controversy and keep only the most important claims pertaining to RQT. Most notably, it is much shorter. So, I propose that we replace the existing camp statement with this one. What do you (all) think?\r\n\r\n\r\n<begin>\r\nRepresentational Qualia Theory defines qualia as our subjective experiences (for example, seeing a red strawberry). These subjective experiences are entirely representational experiences. The following example will illustrate what we mean by \"representational\" experiences:\r\n\r\nStrawberries have the causal property of reflecting red light. After reflected red light passes into our human eyes and stimulates the cones on the back of our retinas, we will (in consequence of this signal, and nothing else) form a virtual model in our heads indicating that we believe there is a strawberry out there.This model is not part of the strawberry, nor is it a property of the strawberry. It is only a representation of the strawberry. We derive the \"phenomenal\" experience of seeing red from this model (and not from any contribution by anything else). Hence, the strawberry may be causally red, but this representative model possesses all traits that may be called \"phenomenally red\".\r\n\r\nThe only position asserted in this camp is that experiences of qualia are derived completely and exclusively from representative models in our heads. More specific claims about the nature of qualia, the possible existence of phenomenal properties, theories about the nature or formation of representative models, and so forth are made in child camps.\r\n<end>\r\n','2012-04-03 19:20:10','2012-04-03 19:20:10'),(1326,96,48,'I think that this camp statement would be a VAST improvement over the old one. For example, I don\'t buy the \"greatest discovery\" over hype. Also I myself do NOT believe in this definition of qualia: \r\n\r\n\"The current Property Dualism statement defines quale and since it is a synonym, a phenomenal property to be \"that which cannot be communicated by abstract information alone, without knowing how to properly interpret the representations.\" \r\n\r\nI don\'t believe it because I believe that the \"apparent\" problem is just one of communication, and is not a fundamental principle of nature. In other words: Mary learns something, but not what epiphenomenalists think. \r\n\r\nLet\'s say that I store information about other people\'s brains in compartment A. The experience of red changes neurons in compartment B. Mary stores all information that she knows about other people\'s experience of red in her compartment A. When she sees red for the first time, neurons in compartment B change, so she \"learns something.\" But that does NOT mean that qualia must be epiphenomenal, depend on magic \"phenomenal properties\" such as are claimed by Chalmers etc. \r\n\r\nSo honestly, there are MANY things that I disagree with in RQT. Property Dualism, AND the qualia interpretation problem (apparently). But I agree with the general principle of representationalism. We don\'t see the strawberry, we see our internal models of the strawberry, which are connected to the strawberry by a causal chain. \r\n\r\nSo, I believe that the question is, how best to express this agreement with representationalism, while pushing the issues of disagreement down into the sub camps. I think that Brent can put all his \"qualia interpretation problem\" stuff, and \"greatest discovery\" stuff down in the new PD camp, and the rest of us can be left with a representationalist camp that we can all agree on.','2012-04-03 20:04:17','2012-04-03 20:04:17'),(1329,96,48,'I am surprised to read that there is a thing called \'red light\'.

We can\'t examine it externally by correlating mechanisms of objects in space, we can only understand it by feeling the experience. The experience is that we see the world through our eyes and in our imagination. It is one continuous or gestalt inertial frame of perception. Perception is a concentrating principle which extracts coherent wholes from elided from parts.

Anything more reductionist than that fails to address anything more than a straw man of perception. Of course, I would go further to say that the idea of a \"model\" is superfluous and occurs to us only as a second-hand strategy employed by our cognitive activities. If we need a model to see through our own eyes, then there is no reason to think that retinal cells also need a model, and if they did, why wouldn\'t the models need models also? At some point something has to sense something, so the addition of abstraction layers to me seems redundant.

We infer that there are invisible, intangible forces propagating through space as \'energy\' when I am increasingly convinced that while this model is probably necessary to model physical phenomena, what is actually happening is that we are projecting mechanism onto a distant and unfamiliar perceptual frame (or \'world\'). \r\n\r\nWhy we project unconscious manipulation by external forces rather than scaled down sense and motive in the microcosm is explained through the symmetry of sense and motive itself. Just as the amplitude of magnetic strength runs orthogonally to the amplitude of electric strength (and I think this is what EM is, a \'waving\' of potency or force of sensitivity and motive power rather than literal waves-of-\'energy\' that exist independently of matter), I suggest that there is a sense-motive conjugate to electro-magnetism. This conjugate is absolutely symmetrical to EM in every way. Where EM is literal, generic, external, public, a-signifying, entropic, etc, SM is the contrary; figurative, proprietary, internal, private, signifying, teleological, etc. \r\n\r\nThis symmetry is so absolute and universal, and our immersion within it so inescapable, that we cannot see the forest for the trees, so to speak. I call it \'the elephant in every room\'. Not only splitting our attention between the forest and the trees problematic, we would need to add to that a splitting of the sense of a literal forest made of literal trees outside and a figurative tree of figurative forests inside. Just as this paragraph exists as a physical hierarchy of sentences, words, characters, pixels, and electronically manipulated matter across space, there is an experiential narrative that can be recovered *through* the experience of reading and understanding (don\'t get me started on understanding... http://multisenserealism.com/2012/04/07/we-come-from-the-land-down-nter/). This meaningful experience can be said to \'insist\' and it can be described as figurative also as it attracts and binds many associations on many levels but has no central body, rather than a literal body that must be literally associated with other physical bodies by sharing the same space.\r\n\r\nThe notion that everything \'makes sense\' in its own way, and that sense itself limits us from making sense of that very fact is convoluted but I think that it is probably the case. I think that Sense - Motive - \'time\' has to the primitive cosmic essential, and that it reflects back on itself as Matter - Energy - \'space\'. Space and time are ultimately nothing more than cavities separating-multiplying matter-energy (space) and sense-motive (time).\r\n\r\nI know this is probably dense and exhausting to try to follow - I try to make it as concise as I can, but it\'s really a whole new view of the cosmos.

Sense and motive are primordial and cannot be reduced or explained - they can only be experienced directly as interior phenomenology or insistence. They are like the sense of \'who\' and the motive of \'why\'. Matter and energy are the reflected, folded, or second order logic antithesis to the sensorimotive thesis (they are the \'what\' and \'how\' of physical existence). Space and time are null matter and null energy arising as tertiary abstractions from the interaction of sense-motive-matter-energy. This is the where and when. \r\n\r\nBecause they are all essentially the same thing folded in on itself, we can make sense of the universe using any part of the syzygy.

Since everything always moves towards the consensus, any time you check in and update your desires, like this, if it becomes the consensus, that\'s what everyone will do.\r\n\r\nIt appears that you are in the new camp of people that were once supporters of the old RQT camp that included the \'property dualism\' doctrine.\r\n\r\nJames noticed he did not agree with this doctrine, as evidently you and others agree, and so we pushed the \'property dualism\' doctrine out of RQT into a lower level camp.\r\n\r\nThen James created the competitor sub camp to dualism [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/18 Representational Functionalism].\r\n\r\nJames and I also struggled with just what you are talking about.  It seems to many of us that the \"Mind Brain Identity\" doctrine is more important and fundamental than \"property dualism\".  But we must remember how other property dualists feel about this, such as people in the Panexperiantialism, higher dimensional camps, and so on.\r\n\r\n\"Mind Brain Identity\" and \"Property Dualism\" are two orthogonal and independent doctrines, and we must decide which split to make more fundamental.  If we split on \"MBI\" first, this splits the dualist camps on both branches of this split, just like if we split on dualism, first it splits MBI camps into both of these branches.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is, there are currently 21 property dualists, and if you total both the existing \"MBI\" camp, and the new [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/18 Representational Functionalism] on the other branch which also includes the \"MBI\" doctrine (When are you Representational Functionalists going to make this more clear in your camp statement?) there are only 15.  So,  once the MBI people outnumber the Property Dualists, they will have the consensus, and will then be able to do the theoretical revolution of restructuring things, accordingly, moving the MBI split to be more fundamental than dualism.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of the new [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/18 Representational Functionalism] camp?

This is the model of the physical body that we experience and that is also constructed by a representative mechanism. All somatic sensations, including â€˜phantomâ€™ limbs and phantom limb pain, are located in the body image not in the physical body.\r\n\r\nInside our experience of our body-image is an experience of our \"self\" or \"spirit\" or \"I\". This \"I\" is represented as looking out of our eyes within this body image. But of course, this spirit image, unlike everything else in this phenomenal world, has no referent in reality. However, though it has no referent in reality, this in no way means our spirit does not exist. This phenomenal \"spirit\" is what we really, literally, and spiritually are. During \"out of body experiences\" this image of our spirit* leaves our body-image, but remains in the unified phenomenal world of our conscious awareness.\r\n>>>\r\n\r\nI\'m hoping that you\'ve just accidently passed over this, and don\'t really want to throw this out of what you believe, because, to me, there doesn\'t seem to be much left of \'representationalism\' without this?\r\n\r\n\r\n== * Quale Interpretation Problem * ==\r\n\r\nThere is currently a bunch of stuff about what it means to be \'ineffable\', including the doctrine that ineffable properties are properties that suffer from the \'quale interpretation problem\'.

Dennett opens the epistemological crack by claiming that the phenomenal contents do not necessarily bear any similarity whatsoever to the neural vehicles by which they are encoded in the brain. This actually goes beyond Davidson\'s supervenience, because according to Davidson, mental events that are distinct phenomenally, must be distinct neurophysiologically also. This is tantamount to saying that the dimensions of conscious experience cannot be any greater than the dimensions of the corresponding neurophysiological state. Dennett effectively removes this limitation by suggesting that even the dimensionality of the phenomenal contents need not match that of the neural vehicles. And into that epistemological crack, Dennett slips the entire world of conscious experience like a magical disappearing act, where it is experienced, but does not actually exist. But by the very fact that conscious experience, as conceived by Dennett, is in principle undetectable by scientific means, this concept of consciousness becomes a religious rather than a scientific hypothesis, whose existence can be neither confirmed nor refuted by scientific means. In fact Dennett even suggests that there is actually no such thing as consciousness per se, and that belief in consciousness is akin to belief in some kind of mythical nonexistent deity (Dennett 1981). This argument of course is only intelligable from a naÃ¯ve realist perspective, by which the sense-data of conscious experience, so plainly manifest to one and all, are mis-identified as the external world itself, rather than as something going on in the physical brain. \r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nIn fact the only epistemology that is consistent with the modern materialistic world view is an identity theory (Russell 1927, Feigl 1958) whereby mind is identically equal to physical patterns of energy in the physical brain. To claim otherwise is to relegate the elaborate structure of conscious experience to a mystical state beyond the bounds of science. The dimensions of conscious experience, such as phenomenal color and phenomenal space, are a direct manifestation of certain physical states of our physical brain. The only correct answer to Koffka\'s question is that things appear as they do because that is the way the world is represented in the neurophysiological mechanism of our physical brain. The world of conscious experience therefore is in principle accessible to scientific scrutiny after all, both internally through introspection, and externally through neurophysiological recording. And introspection is as valid a method of investigation as is neurophysiology, just as in the case of color experience. Of course the mind can be expected to appear quite different from these two different perspectives, just as the data in a computer memory chip appears quite different when examined internally by data access, as opposed to externally by electrical probes. But the one quantity that is preserved across the mind/brain barrier is information content, and therefore that quantity can help identify the neurophysiological mechanism or principle in the brain whose dimensionality, or information content, matches the observed dimensions of conscious experience. \r\n\r\n','2012-04-26 20:45:19','2012-04-26 20:45:19'),(1449,96,48,'I disagree with your assessment, and that\'s fine.

Since there are people in the RQT camp (like myself) that believe that experience is nothing more than structure and dynamics, but who are definite representationalists, it seems necessary to include SOME sort of a disclaimer when adding the name \"qualia\" to a camp that is designed to include both these groups.

The main difference in reflectance between unripe and ripe strawberries is in the region of 450 to 570 nm. At 630 to 700+ nm there is hardly a difference. The difference between unripe and ripe is due to the differences in absorption of electromagnetic energy by L and M cones, with redness essentially being determined by L cone and greenness by M cone absorption. \r\nL cone absorption at 720 nm is 0.1% of that at 570 nm, i.e. L cone absorption at 720 or even 650 nm is exceedingly small.

But I think for this theoretical work, we need to simplify and focus only on what is important, and ignore how complex the actual perception process is.  The bottom line is, when we see something that is reflecting 650 NM light, we represent it with redness, and when we see something reflecting more or less 700 NM light, we experience greenness.  Of course itâ€™s not exactly 700 NM light, but all that complexity is not important for what we need to communicate here.\r\n\r\nMike, you mentioned that someone objected to using the term 650 NM light?  Who was that?  Iâ€™ve never seen any objection to such.  We use the simple term â€œreflects 650 NM lightâ€ in all the other camps.  So to rename it to be â€œRERâ€ (what does that even stand for?) just for this camp seems completely wrong to me.  Does anyone really object to just using the property of â€œreflects 650 NMâ€ light for the initial â€˜causeâ€™ of the perception process and phenomenal redness (aka a red quale) as a property of the final result of the perception process?\r\n\r\nTerminology is critically important for good communication and is the biggest problem with this theoretical field.  Currently, most everyone means something completely different when they use specific terms like qualia.  So each camp shouldnâ€™t have its own special terms defined.  If we need to define anything, it should be done in separate topics (as is done with â€˜effâ€™ http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/102/2) or at worst, in the root agreement statement, as we all need to use the same terms, which mean the same thing to everyone, for everything, as much as possible.\r\n\r\nAlso, Steve, thanks for jumping in and pointing out how â€œDennett\'s argument that our experience seems different than we experience it to be, is a stark bald paradoxical contradiction in terms!â€.\r\n\r\nTalking to qualophobe people like Mike and James, like this, reminds me of talking to NaÃ¯ve realists.  Their models of reality are so completely inadequate at explaining everything.  They are so clueless about just how inadequate their models are.  They donâ€™t even know what they mean when they say â€˜it seems redâ€™.  For example, just look at Mikeâ€™s comment about my proposed statement: â€œWhether or not such knowledge is a mistaken representation or mistaken interpretation of something else is irrelevantâ€.  He asked:\r\n\r\n    â€œirrelevant to what question?\r\n    A statement such as \"redness arises from\r\n    the brain\'s inaccurate ability to model\r\n    causal properties of the strawberry\",\r\n    whether true or not, would certainly be\r\n    relevant and profound with respect to\r\n    understanding the nature of qualia.â€\r\n\r\nThis just starkly illustrates how confused Mike is, and how inadequate his models of anything important are.  Just the fact that you have to ask what is irrelevant, says volumes about your ignorance, to me.  It seems to me youâ€™re clearly still thinking â€˜rednessâ€™ is a property of the strawberry or has something to do with the causal properties, and that the brain is having troubles â€˜modelingâ€™ these.  James, what could you possibly mean when you say â€˜model causal propertiesâ€™ here???  Can you not see how you are just saying you know something, and there is nothing that is that knowledge, or maybe you are saying the knowledge is just a miracle we donâ€™t need to worry about or worse?  Can you please give me a definition of â€˜modelâ€™ or â€˜seemâ€™ â€“ hopefully a definition sufficient so we could implement something doing the same thing, artificially, in any possible theoretical world, let alone this one?\r\n\r\nWhen we first started all this, I fully expected the â€˜qualiaâ€™ issue to be forced below the representational issue, a long time ago.  It has amazed me just how long RQT has survived with the world â€˜qualiaâ€™, and I expected there to be qualia representationalists, and a lot more qualophobe representationalists, like Dennett, Minsky, the Chruclands, et all.  I figured the qualophobe camp could possibly be the leading consensus, or at least on par with the qualophiles.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s very funny when you are having conversations with qualophiles, like Minsky, Frankish, and so on.  And it is also how amazingly hard it is to recruit anyone like Dennett, or the Churchlands to participate in this canonization process.\r\n\r\nJoseph Smith always talked about a â€˜stupor of thoughtâ€™, and how you could tell you were on the wrong track when this happens.  Initially Frankish was excited about participating, and helping to develop the â€œwe donâ€™t have qualia, it just seems like we do campâ€™  (those were his exact words), but when he saw this one paragraph argument against this, it was as if his â€˜stuper of thoughtâ€™ kicked in, and suddenly he was no longer interested, at all, in this topic, even.  And the same things happens again and again, with Minsky, the churchlands, and any qualophile that thinks this way.\r\n\r\nJames and Mike are the first people to finally step up and make an attempt at defending this POV.  So, thanks Mike and James, it is great to finally have someone willing to take this position, and bravely stand up against these types of devastating arguments.\r\n\r\nAt least theyâ€™ve agreed to allow the word â€˜qualiaâ€™.  And it is at least good to hear people like Dennett, Frankish, and all to talk about something phenomenal, and James and Mike not objecticting to this word.  So, we can no longer ridicule them for being that ignorant.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, Iâ€™ve definitely noticed, that they define the word â€˜qualiaâ€™ to be something very different than what I define the word to be, and all the things that go along with such (as in the â€˜quale interpretation problemâ€™).\r\n\r\nSo, Mike and James, have given in to accepting the word â€˜qualiaâ€™ so we no longer have that big gun to challenge their camp, but it sounds like their giving us almost everything else, including the qualia interpretation problem, you can know something, or something can â€˜seemâ€™ some way, even though there is nothing which is that seeming, and evidently a bunch more.\r\n\r\nSo, if James and Mike only want to take away the word â€˜qualiaâ€™ as our best argument against their view, but leave us with the definition, and everything else about the word, that is fine with me.\r\n\r\nMike and James seem to be working on the assumption, like I once was, that there are lots of qualiphobe experts out there.  But Iâ€™m really starting to doubt this, and wish them the best of luck in achieving any kind of consensus in this qualophobe camp.  Iâ€™ve been working for many years, trying to recruit a real qualophobes.  But Mike and James are the first.  It would be exciting to have my theory, that there is no reputable expert consensus, for any kind of qualophobe theory, wrong.  But currently, Iâ€™m in the camp that thinks there is near zero expert consensuses, and what consensus there is is fading fast, given the powerful arguments being â€˜canonizedâ€™ against any such view.\r\n\r\nSo, again, what do you say, Mike and James.  Can we include a statement like this in the RQT camp:\r\n\r\n    \"People like Daniel Dennett often make a claim like\r\n    we don\'t have qualia, \"it just seems like we do\"\r\n    [Consciousness Explained P. 375].  Qualia are\r\n    properties of our incorrect or \'seeming\' knowledge.\r\n    Whether or not such knowledge is a mistaken\r\n    representation or mistaken interpretation of\r\n    something else is irrelevant to what where and\r\n    how qualia are.\"\r\n\r\nOr are you going to give that up as a huge argument for us, youâ€™ll have to attempt to counter, and find people that agree with you, in your camp?

When you say the abstract word: â€œSaltyâ€, unless you know the correct experience of Salty, you donâ€™t know how to interpret the abstract meaning, to derive what it is intended to describe.  If you have experienced the correct quale, and then can interpret the abstract world â€˜saltyâ€™ to represent this, only then can you know what the world â€˜saltyâ€™ means.\r\n\r\nSince all of our senses are based on abstract interpretations of the cause and effect information coming to them, our traditional senses suffer from the â€˜quale interpretation problemâ€™.  We interpret 650 NM light, to represent the fact that the surface of the strawberry reflects 650 NM light.  But of course, the causal properties of the light ariving in our eye are nothing like the sweetness property of a red strawberry.  So our senses interpret one to be abstracted information about its referent.  Ultimately, we interpret this and represent it with our redness quale.  But of course, my redness could be your greenness, or something youâ€™ve never experienced before in your life.  The bottom line, because of the quale interpretation problem, traditional cause and effect based communication and senses, suffer from the quale interpretation problem, and thereby, with only that, quale are ineffable.

Terminology issues are *by far* the biggest time-waster in any discussion, especially any discussion about things that are difficult to \"eff\". Do you think we should start a second Google Doc for this? Is there a good place to put it when we\'re done? (Wikipedia certainly agrees that the term \"qualia\" is tough to define. The first sentence in the definitions section states \"There are many definitions of qualia, which have changed over time.\") Here are my thoughts on your initial definitions:\r\n\r\nRegarding the ineffability of qualia, I certainly agree that the term \"salty\" does not convey enough information to describe my personal experience of tasting something salty, but if I also communicate enough information to reconstruct my entire brain, then I have essentially sent you my interpretation of that word. And if you were a sufficiently advanced post-human, you could use that information to actually sample my experience. Hence, qualia is not theoretically ineffable, it is only ineffable for now, due to the current limitations of humans. Hence, I do not think that defining it in terms of its ineffability is the right approach.\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"the final result of the perception process\" implies things to me that I suspect were not intended. Are you sure that the experience does not begin until the perception process terminates? Couldn\'t the experience happens all along the way? I think the term \"final\" is too strong. The term \"result\" implies something that can be expressed, such as a value, a vector, a matrix, or a graph. Yet, you previously said experiences were ineffable. Also, the \"perception process\" is lacking a clear definition. For example, are the causal properties being represented part of the \"perception process\", or does the \"perception process\" only begin after my percepts are stimulated?\r\n\r\nI think the phrase \"phenomenal properties\" communicates unintended notions. Would you object to eliminating this phrase from our global definitions? I don\'t mind \"phenomenal experiences\" so much because I think it is mostly understood that experiences are representational concepts, but when you say \"phenomenal properties\", it seems like you are suggesting that these phenomenal concepts have some literal or physical existence outside of human mental representations. That is not a deliberate suggestion, is it? Such a suggestion would belong outside of *representational* qualia theory, right? I think a phrase such as \"imagined phenomenal properties\" would convey the intended meaning much more clearly.\r\n','2012-05-02 13:21:31','2012-05-02 13:21:31'),(1503,96,48,'I was going to reply to this, but well...

Iâ€™d prefer to keep these types of communications in the public forums, in hopes that more people will keep up with, and contribute to them.\r\n\r\nAs with many things on this topic, Iâ€™ve noticed our common English is ambiguous about what we need to talk about, when describing necessary components to conscious perception.  For example, the common use of the term â€˜redâ€™ refers to both the initial cause of the perception process, and the experience that results, or a â€˜rednessâ€™ quale.  The two are very different, and we must make sure we specify which we are talking about, and not just use the word â€˜redâ€™ as it means both.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar issue with the definition of â€˜informationâ€™.  Iâ€™m going to start using two different labels for two different types of information, so let me know if you think this helps in communicating what Iâ€™m trying to describe.\r\n\r\n* \'\'\'Abstract Information\'\'\'\r\n* \'\'\'Phenomenal Information\'\'\'\r\n\r\n\'\'\'â€œAbstract Informationâ€\'\'\' is platonic information, and isnâ€™t real, unless it is instantiated on or represented by something physical or real.  Binary values, words, and everything are abstract representations.  Any physical stuff that can assume a sufficiently diverse causally detectible state can represent it, as long as there is an interpreting mechanism to interpret the representation as its intended value.  In other words, it doesnâ€™t matter if it is +5 volts on a line or a magnetic orientation on a disk, as long as something can interpret the representation as a one.  If the interpretation is zero, when it should be one, the interpretation or communication medium / mechanism is obviously failing.\r\n\r\n\'\'\'â€œPhenomenal Informationâ€\'\'\' is a kind of fundamental or intrinsic quality or causal property of nature.  An example is the property a surface of a strawberry has, in that it causes something like 650 NM light to reflect in a particular pattern.  It is true that an abstract word, like red, can represent this property, but unless you know how to properly interpret the word, you wonâ€™t know that it is referring to this fundamental nature of the surface of the strawberry.  Similarly, the light itself can be interpreted to derive abstract information about the fundamental nature of the surface of the strawberry.  Obviously, the fundamental intrinsic properties of the light are nothing like the properties of the surface of the strawberry, but one can be configured and interpreted to model the other â€“ again, as long as you know how to properly interpret such to get the abstract information about the referent represented.\r\n\r\nIt is theoretically possible to assume that these intrinsic fundamental properties of nature include ineffable â€˜phenomenal propertiesâ€™, or something they are phenomenally like.  If we assumed the surface of the strawberry included some ineffable phenomenal property, and that such was a big part of the reason it reflected 650NM light, we would be blind to such.  Obviously, the light would not have the same phenomenal property, and we would not know how to interpret it, as required to â€˜effâ€™ this ineffable information from the abstract information contained in the intrinsic properties of the reflected light.\r\n\r\nMost any material stuff, if you have enough of it, can be configured to represent or model any other material stuff.  Again, only as long as you have something that can interpret it as such.  If something is fundamentally different, whether phenomenal or not, it always requires the proper interpretation to get back to the original fundamental qualities it is intended to represent, especially if you are talking about ineffable phenomenal qualities, like the taste of salt or redness.\r\n\r\nAll abstract information, if you have enough stuff to represent it, can describe or perfectly model any fundamental properties, and visa versa, as long as you know how to properly interpret them, to get the abstract meaning.  If you know that your redness equals â€˜stopâ€™, you must know what the redness is phenomenally and fundamentally like, so you can interpret it correctly, to represent stop.\r\n\r\nAnother issue weâ€™re having is that Mike Gashler is objecting to the usage of the term â€˜redness is the final result of a perception processes.\r\n\r\nSo, in order to better way why I think saying it this way is so important, lets through phenomenal qualities out of the picture, for a moment.  Letâ€™s talk about a robot we build to pick strawberries.  Like us, this robot has stereoscopic cameras, a body with wheels, a container to hold picked strawberries, and an arm to pick strawberries with and deposit them in the container.\r\n\r\nOf course, the initial cause of the perception process for this robot, begins with the reflection of 650 NM light.  The stereo cameras detect this as 2 2D digital images made of ones for red, and zeros for green.  This goes through an image processing system that does edge detection, and stuff, to build a 3D voxelated representation of the strawberry patch â€“ again, with ones in the volume elements where a surface is reflecting 650 NM light, and zeros that represent something that is reflecting 700 nm light reflected from the leaves.  Included in this 3d voxel model, is a representation of the robot, which the brain can move, the basket, and the arm which the brain can control.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms of course detect the 1 colored objects, move close enough to them so the arm is in range, then it moves the arm to pick them.  Of course, the robot knows nothing of the real strawberry patch, it only knows about its knowledge of the strawberry patch.  And of course, this knowledge is the final result of the robots perception process.\r\n\r\nThere may be some naive person, ignorant of the design, who might assert there is not final result, and that there is some magic algorithm, that enables the robot to be directly aware of the strawberry, or in some way achieves picking behavior in some other way, without having such a 3D voxel representation of the strawberry, but of course, you sue the terminology this particular robot has 3D voxel binary knowledge, that is the final result of the Robotâ€™s perception process â€“ I know this, because I designed and built it that way.\r\n\r\nNow, if we through redness in there, instead of ones, the same terminology applies with even more utility â€“ the robot has knowledge of the strawberry, and this knowledge has an intrinsic phenomenal property that is redness.  And this knowledge, when we experience as our conscious knowledge, is the final result of our eyesâ€™ and image processing systemâ€™s perception process.\r\n\r\nSimply saying it is an â€˜experienceâ€™ can be interpreted as if we are experience the redness of the property itself, and it doesnâ€™t even define what such could be (as if some kind of miracle happens in â€˜experienceâ€™ â€“ and that is the fatal problem of just calling it an experience of the perception process, and why I donâ€™t think I can accept such terminology.\r\n\r\n','2012-05-14 20:29:54','2012-05-14 20:29:54'),(1520,96,48,'Brent said: Now, if we throw redness in there, instead of ones...\r\n\r\nI was with you all the way until this statement.

Still, can\'t we just rename it to 2? I\'m really struggling with this notion of phenomenal information.\r\n\r\nBrent said: Simply saying it is an \"experience\" can be interpreted as if we are\r\nexperience the redness of the property itself.\r\n\r\nI agree that we must be careful never to imply that a human (or a robot, or anything else) can directly experience the redness property of a strawberry, or of light, or of anything besides the abstract representation in his/her/its mind. I do, however, intend to suggest that a model comprised exclusively of abstract information is sufficient to trigger an experience of redness. In other words, upon detecting 1s in its memory, a sufficiently complex robot could experience the quale of redness, just like a human. I conjecture that human models consist of nothing besides abstract information, and that the notion of phenomenal information is unnecessary and superfluous to the process of experiencing redness. Belief in phenomenal information is a dualist concept, which we (functional representationalists) reject.\r\n\r\nThe expression, \"qualia are the final result of a perception process\" implies that qualia are the model, which implies that the model contains something phenomenal, which we cannot accept.

Do you reject the suggestion that qualia is an experience rather than phenomenal information? How about \"qualia are (or are derived from) our internal representations\"?

I intended to hit \'edit\' to fix some of those problems, but accidentally hit submit.\r\n\r\nAs far as \"throwing in red\" I meant the second option.  The binary robot represented it\'s knowledge with a binary model, represented with 1s and 0s, for which it doesn\'t matter, especially at the decision level what is representing the ones and zeros.  i.e. the robot only knows that the strawberries are represented with one, and it has no idea what that is like.\r\n\r\nI meant to describe entirely replacing this binary model with a phenomenal model (not just expand it), replace it with one for which the algorithm knows what it\'s redness is like, and is able to chose redness, only because it knows what it\'s representations are phenomenally and fundamentally like.\r\n\r\nSo, in other words, by definition, this theory is simply specifying that there is something fundamentally different than abstract information that can represent such.  It is true, that you can represent it with 2, but again, unless you know how to interpret that abstract representation, you can\'t know the fundamental property that 2 should be interpreted as, without providing effing information enabling the proper interpretation.  That is simply the theory, by definition.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your continued patience with all this, and working so hard to find something that will work for everyone.  This is a huge help!!  It also helps me to understand my theory much better.  I must admit that in addition to the phenomenal properties, that are properties of the model built by our brain, there must be some mechanism that enables the system to know what it\'s representations are like, and enabling the picking of the red ones, because they are red.  It also requires the entire system to have some way of binding everything together so we can be aware of the redness, and the greenness, at the same time.  So, it does make some sense to describe all this as an \'experience\' that results from the model, and it\'s properties.\r\n\r\nWhen you say you: \"intend to suggest that a model comprised exclusively of abstract information is sufficient to trigger an experience of redness.\" are you saying a one, alone, no matter what is representing it, and what is required to interpret it as one, anything like this could produce redness?

I would very much like to clearly include this doctrine in RQT.  I thought the first sentence would accomplish this, and thought this was the sentence Mike was asking for.  But obviously it isn\'t sufficient.\r\n\r\nJames proposes a new version of Dennett\'s we don\'t have qualia it just seems like we do, but to me, this further obfuscates this critically important issue, that we must directly face, not further obfuscate or attempt to hide.\r\n\r\nSo I propose we giving this doctrine some kind of name, and dedicating a section to this doctrine.  Perhaps something like the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n== Physical Law of Information ==\r\n\r\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory  Shannon Information Theory] is the law that information cannot exist unless there is something physical that is representing it.  This doctrine also specifically defines, mechanically, what it means to \'interpret as\', or to \'seem\' or to be \'perceived as\' or whatever.  All such notions require two parts.  There is what is being perceived, and there is the perception.  Both must be physically real, and to \'interpret\' is to map one, from one physical representation to another, that also must be physical.\r\n\r\nOur brains tends to represent notions like \'seeming\' in a very naive and insufficient way.  When we see the bent pencil, sticking out of the glass of water, our brain represents it as if there is the real pencil, we know is straight - but that is the end of our intuitive knowledge.  There is no notion that we have knowledge that really is bent.  But this is, according to Information Theory, impossible,  If it \'seems\' bent, there must be something that is your bent knowledge, or something that is the seeming, the way we interpret what our senses are telling us about the pencil.\r\n\r\nWhen people like Daniel Dennett try to hide \'qualia\' in some kind of naive view of \'to seem\', when they say something like we don\'t have qualia , it only seems like we do, they should at a very minimum, define, mechanically, what they mean by seeming.  Since to the rest of us that understand the physical law of information, it just looks like they are clearly falling into this naive trap, and missing the fact that there must be something that is the seeming.

However whatever form is selected for encoding data in the computer, the information content of that data cannot possibly be of higher dimensionality than the information explicitly expressed in the physical state of the machine. The same principle must also hold in perceptual experience, as proposed by MÃ¼ller (1896), in the psychophysical postulate. MÃ¼ller argued that since the subjective experience of perception is encoded in some neurophysiological state, the information encoded in that conscious experience cannot possibly be any greater than the information encoded in the corresponding neurophysiological state.While we cannot observe phenomenologically the physical medium by which perceptual information is encoded in the brain, we can observe the information encoded in that medium, expressed in terms of the variables of subjective experience. It follows therefore that it should be possible by direct phenomenological observation to determine the dimensions of conscious experience, and thereby to infer the dimensions of the information encoded neurophysiologically in the brain.','2012-05-18 12:58:01','2012-05-18 12:58:01'),(1545,96,48,'\r\nAh, thatâ€™s great; Steve, to talk about quantity of information content, and that it cannot exceed that which is physically represented.\r\n\r\nI fixed some things in my proposed new doctrine section, and integrated this concept into a new statement, and added it to the document (intended to replace the 3 paragraphs that still follow this section.)\r\n\r\n','2012-05-18 14:15:22','2012-05-18 14:15:22'),(1548,96,48,'Brent, this is my attempt to respond to: when they say something like we don\'t have qualia , it only seems like we do, they should at a very minimum, define, mechanically, what they mean by seeming.\r\n\r\nObviously I cannot speak for Daniel Dennett, but this seems (half-pun, sorry) well-defined to me, so I\'d like to take a stab at defining what I think he means by \"seems\". (Of course, I don\'t expect you to agree, I just want to show that no one is using vague or undefined terms here.)\r\n\r\nThe model (or representation) of the real world created by the human mind provides the very definition of what \"seems to be\". If our model says the world is a certain way, then it seems to be that way. If something \"seems\" a certain way, then the model in our head *is* representing it that way. The model *is* the thing that *is* that information. The model satisfies the mandates of information theory.\r\n\r\nIn the real world, the pencil is straight. In our model, the pencil bends where it enters the water. The model is wrong, but it is well-defined. The pencil \"seems\" bent because the model says it is bent, even though it is really straight in the real world. The strawberry \"seems\" red, but this is not true either. In the real world, the strawberry reflects 720nm light, which is not the same thing as being red. Once again, the model is wrong, and that creates what \"seems to be\". When you put your hand in fire, it seems to hurt, but in reality the tissue in your hand is being destroyed by intense chemical reactions, which is not the same as pain. The model in your brain does not understand \"being destroyed by chemical reactions\", so it models it as closely as it can--with pain. When your model is accurate, then \"what seems to be\" is the same as \"what really is\". Since qualia does not occur in the real world, all qualia are fallacious representations of the real world--experiences that seem real but are actually poor approximations of a more complex world. All qualia are illusions. They just \"seem\" real because our model says they *are* real, and the model is wrong.\r\n\r\nWhere is the \"miracle\" in that? Misrepresenting the world doesn\'t seem all that impressive to me. I would be more impressed if our brains build more accurate models, allowing us to see the strawberry as it really is, reflecting 720nm light. A better example of an ill-defined \"miracle\" would be seeing fundamental red painted on the models in our brains. How could that possibly work?

I admit that the brain may not have enough information to build a strictly accurate model. Building a strictly correct model may be an impossible task. I also think that the brain does a darn fine job, and that it has created a rather ingenious substitute for the physics that it failed to correctly model. But no matter how you look at it, the model is not a strictly accurate representation of reality. Red may be beautiful. It may be wonderful.

I believe James proposed the first question be something like:\r\n\r\n# Is there something beyond structure and dynamics of physics?\r\n** Yes: Property Dualism.\r\n** No: Representational Functionalism.\r\n\r\nBut this is problematic, to me, because I belong in the \"Property Dualism\" camp, yet I agree with the statement that there is nothing \"beyond structure and dynamics of physics\".  I believe we only have abstracted interpreted knowledge about the \'structure and dynamics of physics\', and that there is something more  than this abstract knowledge, not something more than the actual structure and dynamics of the actual fundamental physics itself.\"  My model is that we are simply blind to these ineffable phenomenal properties of the structure and dynamics of physics, until we discover what it is that  has them, and thereby know how to get more than just the interpreted abstract information about such, from our senses.  In other words, until we know what this abstract information comment to us through our senses phenomenal \'means\' and how to interpret it, we will be missing something in our knowledge of the \'structure and dynamics of physics\"\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n=================================\r\n\r\n\r\n= Physical Law of Information =\r\n\r\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory  Shannon Information Theory] is the idea that you cannot have information content greater than that which is physically represented.

We assume Dennett, instead, might be trying to refer to someone assuming that the above model of seeming represents something beyond the structure and dynamics of physics, then this does make sense.

MPD predicts there are two drastically different types of information.  There is abstract information, and there is phenomenal information.\r\n\r\nAbstract Information, is not like anything and is not real, in a platonic kind of way, other than it can be represented or instantiated by something physical.  The only way to get the information from the physical representation, is to properly interpret the properties of whatever is representing it.\r\n\r\nPhenomenal information is very different, in a fundamental and phenomenally real way.  Phenomenal information is \'ineffable\', unlike abstract information.  It is based on the fact that something like a pattern of 650NM light, reflected off of a strawberry, is nothing like what it can be interpreted as representing - the properties of the surface of the strawberry.  The fact that the map, is not the territory, is critically important.  You must properly interpret one, to arrive at the referent, to know what it is phenomenally, (and causally, for that matter) like.\r\n\r\nMPD simply predicts that these phenomenal properties are a different kind of fundamental dimension to the causal properties, of the same.  Functional Property Dualism says that these real properties are somehow tied to the right \'function\' in some magical or \'hard\' way.  Either way, these phenomenal properties, like causal properties, must be a property of something real.\r\n\r\nThe way I like to think about it, is we all know what the redness of a surface of the strawberry is like.  We all initially naively think it is a property of the strawberry.  Nobody has any problem with thinking of redness, in this way - we think of it as tightly integrated with the fact that it reflects 650NM light.  Even though we know it is, instead, a property of our knowledge, we should still think of it, in the same way as we think of redness being a property of the strawberry - just now think of it as, instead, a property of something in our brain - just as it seems.  This property of knowledge, is the seeming.  Both types of properties can be interpreted as the other, but one, without knowing how to properly interpret what is representing it, is only abstract.\r\n\r\nDoes that help answer your questions?\r\n\r\n','2012-06-01 01:29:42','2012-06-01 01:29:42'),(1656,96,48,'I have come to see the notion of phenomenal information as flawed.

It confuses the phenomenological substrate (or carrier as slehar said) with the ephiphenomenal content of phenomenology.\r\n\r\nThis is the symbol grounding problem, the Chinese Room, Use/Mention distinction, and as Brent cited the Map/Territory dichotomy. The thing about using the world information or representation in the context of qualia is that you are making the territory a type of map, which is really upside down. The map is a territory which we can superimpose over another territory using our capacity to \'make sense\' - to extend our direct awareness with our own semiotic capacities.\r\n\r\nIt is useful to think of qualia as information or representation if you are doing engineering or neuroscience, but to really understand qualia I think you have to see it as absolutely primordial and concrete. The red of the strawberry is as much a part of the strawberry as the smell, shape, taste, chemistry, etc. There is nothing that we can know about the strawberry that is any more objectively real than the redness we see. All of it\'s properties are figments of our relation to it in size, velocity, instruments used to measure, etc. If the red is in our brain, then so is the entire universe.\r\n\r\nThe way to get out of this absurdity is to see that the fundamental principle of the universe has both presentational and representational aspects.

Once you make the realisation that any of the so called \'information\' that exists in our minds is in fact a form of qualia, much of this debate melts away. A great deal of argument has always arisen from fundamental misunderstandings of what the concept of a quale really implies. However, you kind of wave your hand a little bit there to get rid of the idea of solipsism, and I take issue with that. \r\n\r\nWhen you consider that qualia are all we really can know, the idea of knowing of anything beyond that (I.e. The existence of an underlying \'reality\' starts to seem a little weird). This is of course talking purely from a deductive standpoint - however the \'sense\' you refered to is a reasonably sound kind of induction, which may or may not constitute actual knowledge (depending on your standards). \r\n\r\nWell that\'s one side of it, but then consider the contradictions which begin to arise when you allow qualia and its alleged physical (let\'s say neurological) correlates to coexist within your paradigm. If you follow this through, the role of qualia can be no more than as epiphenomena, with no influence on behaviour. This contradicts a notion which many have of qualia performing a function, for example the response to pain being seen as a result of pain\'s qualitative character. But of course, the process of pain response (and indeed all brain events) is entirely explicable within a physical framework, with no real \'room\' for a nonphysical property to interfere - this is the whole fundamental issue in the hard problem of consciousness. But this isn\'t in and of itself an issue with the idea of coexistance. Issues do arise, however, when we start to look at why on Earth we were ever able to consider qualia in the first place. \r\n\r\nConsider an automaton, which lacks whatever magic property that gives the spark of qualia - it might very well integrate indistinguishably from a human in any aspect of life, but since it doesn\'t have experience in the way we do, one might imagine it would have a hard time understanding what all of us on canonizer were talking about. But wait - if qualia are epiphenomena with no physical causal properties, then how are *we* able to understand it? The act of understanding or thinking about qualia, in the coexistance framework, is indeed a series of physical events. We do not \'observe\' qualia as we do with our senses (for allowing this would lead to an infinite regression post haste), so given their epiphenomenal nature, how could we ever notice them. In the framework which allows physical reality, it seems inevitable that our brains are no more than richly functional automatons, and yet the very notion of realising that we have qualia seems to contradict this. It would appear that a false premise has been assumed, and I wouldn\'t immediately dismiss on the grounds of \'sense\' that this false premise may very well be the existence in the first place of a physical world. \r\n\r\nThere are other issues too, such as the apparent granularity of reality - particularly in brain structure - which seems to interfere with the idea of the smooth, whole, analogue conscious experience we have, and it\'s hard to imagine how these could coexist. \r\n\r\nBut of course this isn\'t fully relevant to the debate at hand, it was just a little point I felt like making to address your otherwise sound arguments.\r\n\r\nJordan T','2012-06-01 11:16:45','2012-06-01 11:16:45'),(1665,96,48,'Brent, sure I don\'t have a problem with inverted qualia.

We know that people wearing image inverting glasses quickly compensate for the upside down reality and see it right side up.

If we truly believe that qualia is an encoded abstraction, then that sense of difference between inner and outer realism must also be an illusion. If we pick and choose which qualia we deem to be fundamentally real and external and those which seem unreal, then we privilege the cognitive bias of the picker to define reality rather than to accept all of our experience as either solipsistic, realistic, or, as I see it, sense which bridges and defines the two through semantic modulation and diffraction.\r\n\r\nMike - One thing we can all agree on is that we can all appreciate a good visual diagram, and that has to count for something. To be nitpickingly precise, I say the building block of realism is sense. Qualia is more like the Orientation of sense, while quanta is the occidental objectification-reduction of qualia.\r\n\r\nThe relevant questions I think are - \r\n\r\nCan information inform without being detected or making sense to something? \r\n\r\nI would say no. \r\n\r\nCan sense be experienced without being presented as discrete sequences of data? \r\n\r\nYes, of course. Data is new to human beings. A CD of music is not music. No non-aural representation of the data on an mp3 file can be said to resemble music in any way. Qualia is not information, but it does inform. \r\n\r\nWhat do we mean by information and representation?\r\n\r\nTo say that information is regular or arithmetic takes that experiential quality of pattern recognition for granted. What seems like a perfectly clear sign to us has no such clarity or significance to an organism of the estimated \"~8.7 million (Â±1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally\". Does a blue whale appreciate the statistical curve of a parabola? It seems obvious to us - the parabola \'simply is\' meaningful...but it\'s not universally meaningful, and it doesn\'t seem solipsistic either. Parabola is qualia, albeit flat to the point of mathematical abstraction (hence its ready extension into geometric universality). The key is understanding the directly proportionate relation between depth-richness of qualia and it\'s privacy. \r\n\r\nWhat we are talking about here is whether to believe the picture of the world we see or the reflection in a mirror inside that picture in which we are invisible. We can\'t doubt that we see, but we can and should doubt the picture within the picture that leaves us out. Think of it as a spiritual IQ test. If we aren\'t smart enough to assert your own legitimacy, then maybe we don\'t deserve to go on to the next phase of civilization.

So, in my mind, you are achieving your lack of magic in your model/theory, by arguing there is nothing that we know that requires such.\r\n\r\nAnd I might point out that all such \'hard AI\' or \'pure science\' type people, when they say things like there are no such things as ineffable properties, or that there is only diet qualia, or anything even close to that, the majority of experts, and the lay population, no longer trust anything you say from then on, because saying that is more absolutely wrong, to most of us, than almost anything else we know or could say.  That is why the term ineffable exists in the first place.  No matter how you describe the taste of salt, even with an infinite set of abstracted symbols, it will always be insufficient to describe that ineffable property.

All things of which humans are aware are represented somehow in their heads. If there is anything that is not represented in a person\'s head, he or she is not aware of it. There is no need for any other function or process to explain awareness. Having a model of something *is* being aware of it.\r\n\r\nI think we both agree with the awareness axiom, right?

A hallucination is a delusion caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. (For example, PCP may cause neurons to mis-fire, triggering a false awareness of things that are not real.) Dreams are a delusion caused by sleep. A mirage is a delusion caused by a misunderstanding of what one is looking at. (Specifically, heat rising from desert sand seems to warp light in a manner somewhat similar to that caused by pools of water.)\r\n >>>>\r\n\r\nAgreed.\r\n\r\n <<<<\r\n\'\'\'Representational Functionalism Conjecture:\'\'\' Qualia is a delusion caused by the brain\'s insufficiency to fully represent the physical world.\r\n\r\nFor example, the causal property of reflecting 720nm light is too much for the brain to model. It tries, but fails, and results in an inaccurate model. Remember that this (flawed) model constitutes the person\'s awareness. So, the person then says, \"I am aware that this strawberry is red\". The person is wrong. Strawberries are not red. Redness is a delusion.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a superior post-human might look upon the same strawberry and be aware that the strawberry is reflecting 720nm light. This superior post-human has a superior model. His model is more complete and more accurate. His awareness is superior to that of the human who experiences redness. Does the post-human experience redness? No, he experiences something better: truth, reality, correctness. He does not have the delusion of redness, as the human has.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most prominent feature of the Representational Functionalism Conjecture is that it contains NO MAGIC WHATSOEVER. It explains qualia by simply disparaging the brain. Now, let us contrast this with the property dualism conjecture:\r\n >>>\r\n\r\nYes, I agree, no magic, because you see no need for such, as I said above.\r\n\r\n <<<<\r\n\'\'\'Property Dualism Conjecture:\'\'\' Qualia occurs when the brain builds its representation (or model) with phenomenal information.\r\n >>>>\r\n\r\nWhen you say it this way, it sounds like the qualia doesn\'t exist until the brain builds its representation, which is not an accurate description of the theory.  Whatever it is that has the phenomenal qualities, which our brain uses to build or paint our conscious knowledge out of, has it whether the stuff was in a brain or not.\r\n\r\nYou talked of the superior post-human representing the surface of the strawberry as it really, phenomenally, is.  If we assumed that the surface of the strawberry does, indeed, have some phenomenal property, possibly something no human has ever experienced before, the theory predicts we will be able to augment the brain, so that it\'s knowledge is made of this phenomenal stuff, instead of redness.  In other words, these future beings will know what the surface of the strawberry is really phenomenally like, and hence they will know how to property interpret that abstract information about such, coming to them, via the interpretation of the light (Note, the light is nothing like redness, or the surface of the strawberry, other than our brain is interpreting such) to appropriately represent the surface of the strawberry, with the real thing.  In other words, these future beings will have solved the quale interpretation problem, and will have superior knowledge about what the strawberry is really like.  The prediction is that if it is like anything at all, it is likely nothing any human has ever experienced before.\r\n\r\n <<<<\r\nNote that science has not yet discovered phenomenal information. Science does not know how to detect it. Science does not know whether it exists. Science knows NOTHING of phenomenal information. Phenomenal information is a conjecture. Until science manages to reach phenomenal information, it is magic.\r\n >>>>\r\n\r\nI disagree, we know that redness, and greenness exist, how they are different, and so on, more absolutely, than we know anything else science tells us.  Science, other than absolute, subjective first person experiences, has only provided us with abstract information about reality.  Material Property Dualism is predicting it has provided us with far more scientific abstract information necessary, than to know what has redness, greenness, and so on.  In other words, the prediction is that you don\'t need to get close to the quantum level of detail or anything, to be able to discover what it is that has redness or the relationship between what we experience, and what we know abstractly.)  The only thing required, is to discover and map redness, and all the fundamental qualia, with the right abstract information about the stuff, in the right state, so we know how to properly interpret the abstract information we already have, which is plenty sufficient to describe all we need to know, except how to phenomenally interpret such information.\r\n\r\n <<<<\r\nNow, who is making the magic fallacy? Perhaps some day science will discover phenomenal information. When that happens, the magic will disappear and property dualism will become science. Until then, it can only be a stub for something that we do not understand. It fills a gap of understanding and assigns a label to it, but it does not explain the thing that fills the gap. In other words, it is a perfect poster-child of the magic fallacy.\r\n >>>\r\n\r\nOK, admittedly, you have me here.  You are right with this.  But at the fundamental level, we all rely on some kind of Magic.  For example, we don\'t know why there is gravity and why Force = Mass * Acceleration - that is the magic part.  We just know that this magic behaves, as the models predict, and such knowledge enables us to explain and predict why celestial objects behave the way they do, and why.  And it enables us to also now dance in the heavens with them - despite not knowing what or why this fundamental \'magic\' is.\r\n\r\nBut this magic, is clearly at the fundamental level, like gravity is.  You can reduce \'Mind\', \'Consciousness\', \'Intentionality\', \'free will\', and all those things to something built out of physical matter that also has phenomenal properties.  If we discover that it is glutamate that has a redness we experience, we won\'t know why, we\'ll just know that it does, and this predictability will enable us to solve the quale interpretation problem and finally eff the ineffable.  It will finally enable us to see the spiritual properties of what science has been telling us all along.\r\n\r\n <<<<\r\n\'\'\'Mike\'s Interpretation of Dennett:\'\'\' When Dennett says \"It just seems like we have qualia\", he is saying \"our representation (or model) is what makes qualia, but this representation does not accurately represent the physical world\". This can be said more succinctly as, \"qualia is delusion\". When he says \"We do not really have qualia\", he is making an error. Certainly he believes we have delusions. His next phrase makes this very clear. What is is really saying is, \"There is nothing magical or phenomenal involved in experiences of qualia\". What he is basically saying is, \"I am not making the magic fallacy, those property dualism guys are\". He is saying the \"phenomenal information is a stub for something science does not understand--which means it is magic\". He is pointing out that he has a complete conjecture for the nature of qualia, while the property dualists have an incomplete conjecture, as evidenced by their use of \"phenomenal information\", which is just a stub for the magical part that science does not understand.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the biggest draw for me to representational functionalism is also its lack of a magical component. If you could help me to understand that property dualism really does not have a magical component, I think I might be able to convert. Otherwise, I like the complete explanation of representation functionalism much better.\r\n >>>>\r\n\r\nAs I suspected, we are talking about two completely different things here.  Everything you say here is only consistent with him saying something like: \"The strawberry doesn\'t have redness, it just seems like it does.\"  We both clearly agree with this, and I agree with all you are saying above.  But Dennett is saying something completely different here.  He is not talking about the strawberry, or perception of anything at all.  He is talking about our knowledge of the strawberry.  He is saying we don\'t have this phenomenal knowledge, (whether it is a representation initiated by a strawberry, or it could be a drug induced hallucination, in a room with no light) he  just says it only seems like we have this phenomenal knowledge.\r\n\r\n  <<<<\r\nOn another topic, I suspect that if we send Dennett a personal note from just one of us, he would be more likely to respond. If we approach him as a group, it feels more like we are trying to push him into taking a public position on some issue. I think that is the sort of thing he would expect compensation for. If we get a personal response first, then we could still follow up with a group assault, but we\'d still have an answer to fall back on if he declines to become involved at that point.\r\n >>>>\r\n\r\nVery good point!

I think I may be finally starting to understand property dualism!\r\n* I admit that every explanation ultimately relies on fundamental axioms, which are essentially reliable models of magic. I confess, in that respect, RF relies on magic too. The difference is that PD relies on a magical component for which a reliable model is not yet available.

Gazilions of â€˜hard scientistâ€™ like people have this as their argument for why we donâ€™t have qualia, itâ€™s just that nobody ever formally and rigorously states it that way, at least that I know of.  You really have to work to recognize when a person is making this argument, as so many people do, because nobody ever says it in these clear kinds of terms.\r\n\r\nDennett only really says this in a roundabout, seeming to not be thinking in a clear way, on page 375 of his book Consciousness Explained.  There are torrents for the pdf of this book, so if you donâ€™t have a hard copy, you should be able to download and find this.  He basically says a bunch of stuff, giving the general idea that we donâ€™t have qualia, then finally he at least says â€œit only seems like we do.â€  So you should be able to search for that string to find where he almost says this.  Basically, that entire book, and the gist of his \"multiple drafts\" ideas, comes down to this simple idea, in a very complex, almost impossible to understand, and see the problems, way.\r\n\r\nOther philosophers donâ€™t seem to think about this, clearly, either, and get lost in all the unnecessarily complected details, the same way.  For example, when I was first talking with Keith Frankish, I detected he was making this argument, just like Dennett does, getting completely lost in all the overly complex details.  So I finally asked him: â€œSo youâ€™re saying we donâ€™t have qualia, it only seems like we doâ€.  It seemed to me that he basically had to stop and think about it for a while, and finally, he said, yes, you are right, this is basically the idea around what Dennett and I are arguing.  Yes, our camp is the â€œwe donâ€™t have qualia, it only seems like we doâ€ camp.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, from the religious / feeling side of the fence, they are mostly completely unable to think about anything in any kind of clear way, they are just all about how things feel.  And they just know something is wrong about what Dennett and everyone is saying, they just canâ€™t even realize what it is Dennett is saying, in a clear way, let alone be able to point out the mistake in the logic.\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve been struggling around this issue from both sides for the longest time, trying to get my hand on exactly what was going on here.  Only when we started this canonizion process, and I was trying to explain it to people like you, and others, did this finally become clear for everyone, exactly what is going on, and how to talk about it so both sides can understand.  Even now, we still have a long way to go to better accomplish this.  So, as far as I know, being enabled by this canonization process, we are the first people to fully understand and start to address this critically important problem in this way.\r\n\r\nSo that is why Iâ€™m so excited about the possibility of getting more clarification from Dr Dennett, to see if he, like Keith Frankish, has troubles getting the problem at first, or if he might have some better insights for all of us, or anything.  It seems to me, Keith Frankish, when he, or at least his sub conscious, first started realizing the error in this line of reasoning, he suddenly had a stupor of thought, and lost interest in it, and hence is not interested in participating any more?

You give evolution bad grades that it doesnâ€™t deserve at all because of your fascination with single wavelength light. This occurs in nature only extremely rarely, like when somewhere pure sodium gets heated until it gives off nearly single wavelength light. In 19.999% of all cases light is broadband multi-wavelength and objects reflect it as multi-wavelengths across the visible spectrum. In a sunset half of the spectrum might get absorbed by air impurities and the result is an orange-red appearance but that is about the greatest reduction of full-spectrum light in nature. The task for evolution was to make it possible to distinguish between an infinity of broad-band spectra in a manner that was efficient, requiring relatively little energy. The solution for our ancestors was three detector types and a mechanism that can distinguish a million or more broad-band spectra in a manner useful to them in terms of continuity of the species. There are also several special mechanisms to further improve detection and distinction. We are doing quite well with the system and the implicit qualia. \r\nThe reflectance function of a ripe strawberry is broad, from 400 to to 700 nm and peaking beyond 700 nm. When viewing a ripe strawberry in daylight the dominant wavelength of the reflected light in data I have is actually at 604 nm. Because of metamerism the complete stimulus coming from the strawberry into the eye can be matched with many different combinations of spectral lights. To take just two of them: the light can be matched with a combination of 74% light of 650 nm, 20% â€˜yellowâ€™ light of wavelength 580 nm and 6% of â€˜blueâ€™ light of 430 nm; or it can be matched with 87% of light of 604 nm and 13% of light of 430 nm. This changes, of course, if the illuminating light is not regular daylight. So what exactly is the stimulus representing the redness of the strawberry?  There are infinitely many possible ones. What they have in common is the identical light absorption (for the standard observer) in the three cone types resulting from these different stimuli. Metamerism does not only exist in color vision but also in form vision and taste: there are many chemicals that taste sweet to us. There is no foreseeable need for a super-human of the future to distinguish between individual wavelengths. As it is we can in some regions of the spectrum distinguish between wavelengths about 2-3 nm apart. If she needs to distinguish them more closely she can use a spectrophotometer as we can.\r\n\r\nSo letâ€™s remain realistic and stay out of fantasy land by calling redness a delusion. Yes, by spacing the cone absorptions a bit more regular and perhaps have a fourth cone type we could distinguish wavelengths across the visible spectrum every 1-2 nm different.  Where should the limit be in your ideal situation? Every tenth of an nm, every 100th? \r\nI am also suggesting that we recognize the plural form of â€˜qualiaâ€™ in our conversations.\r\n','2012-06-05 00:27:17','2012-06-05 00:27:17'),(1701,96,48,'I agree with rolfk. Keep in mind what we\'re all actually talking about here.\r\n\r\nStraight from Wikipedia: \r\n\r\n\"Qualia ( /ËˆkwÉ‘ËliÉ™/ or /ËˆkweÉªliÉ™/), singular \"quale\" (Latin pronunciation: [ËˆkwaËle]), from a Latin word meaning for \"what sort\" or \"what kind,\" is a term used in philosophy to refer to subjective conscious experiences as \'raw feels\'. Daniel Dennett writes that qualia is \'an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us: the ways things seem to us.\' Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger had this counter-materialist take: \'The sensation of colour cannot be accounted for by the physicist\'s objective picture of light-waves. Could the physiologist account for it, if he had fuller knowledge than he has of the processes in the retina and the nervous processes set up by them in the optical nerve bundles and in the brain? I do not think so.\' \"\r\n\r\nThe fallacy Mike seems to be making lies within his failure to grasp what people are talking about when they speak of qualia. By definition, they are subjective entities which arise from physiological conscious processes. That is, specifically not some objective property parameter of physical things. It\'s fair enough if people want to go about making their own definitions of what qualia are, but any definition which does not concede their subjectiveness and privacy fails to capture the ontology of the matter.

You talk about glutamate, a neurotransmitter - to me that would still come under the \'physiological conscious process\' heading, or at least an aspect of that. \r\n\r\nIt is a perfectly valid idea to suppose that qualia is a property of neurotransmitter chemicals. However, given the definition of a qualia as a subjective experience or \'raw feel\' (which is pretty much the common one by the way, not just my own), I would definitely consider it interesting to know just how the methods of objective science could identify such a property in the absence of a conscious agent capable of directly reporting it.

FPD says that there IS something more, but that this \"more\" lives in the information (like the ones and zero\'s). BOTH RF and FPD think that you can simulate qualia on a computer, JUST by simulating the functionality of the system. But FPD things that this simulation carries the \"MORE\" stuff, and RF thinks that there IS no MORE to have. \r\n\r\n\"This is all so hard to say, because, I believe all qualia can be\r\nrepresented, it\'s just that, in my world/theory, you need to know how to interpret them to get to the phenomenal/fundamental meaning or what they are like, from any set of ones and zeros.\"\r\n\r\nAnd my theory is that there IS nothing more to interpret. If the right behavior is produced, then there IS nothing else to interpret. The qualia are there, in the system that produces the behavior. If it produces the right behavior, then it MUST have been interpreted correctly. \r\n\r\nAnd of course, basically, you also must then be saying the term â€˜ineffableâ€™ is basically a meaningless term\"\r\n\r\nYUP!\r\n\r\n\"and should probably be removed from the English language, since it causes us to have false beliefs like redness is ineffable, or that the taste of salt canâ€™t be communicated by abstract symbols, without knowing how to interpret them.\"\r\n\r\nYUP. I don\'t believe in the explanitory gap. The only gap appears because of the limitations of our language... BUT if I communicated all the sates of all the neurons in your brain, I DID communicate the experience (if you can follow all that information). Thus, I just effed the \"SEEMINGLY ineffable\". \r\n\r\n\"So, I guess we would both agree that material property dualism is predicting that gradual substitution of neurons, with any abstract system like one based on silicone, will not be possible, without the person noticing a big difference in his redness\" \r\n\r\nThat\'s your baby, you tell me what MPD predicts. I have no idea, because if the qualia are epiphenomenal, the person would notice the difference, but BEHAVE no differently... which is a contradiction as far as I am concerned. If the qualia are NOT epiphenomenal, then I challenge you to produce a mathematically rigorous example of how this would work. To date you have failed to produce such a model. As fare as I can tell, there is no consistent way of formalizing PD that doesn\'t produce epiphenomenalism. If I am wrong, then by all means, SHOW ME A MATHEMATICALLY RIGOROUS EXAMPLE THEORY.\r\n\r\n\"while you are predicting it will be possible, and that it will be possible to entirely replace the brain with any abstract silicone, or any other system, and this mind will still be experiencing the same redness.\"\r\n\r\nYES, but RF and FPD predict this. \r\n\r\n\"And this is what the experimental neuro scientists need to seek to do to convert us all to the same camp.\"\r\n\r\nWell, if someone\'s qualia is epiphenomenal, I don\'t see how you can ever be converted. As far as I can tell, you are completely irrational, and no amount of evidence could change your mind. \r\n\r\nYOU claim that your qualia is not epiphenomenal... so I hope to eventually formalize a proof that you can\'t produce non-epiphenomenal qualia from PD, and I hope that THAT will convert you to my camp. \r\n\r\n\"And tell me, again, how you would know if my redness is the same as your redness, or if it is more like your greenness, or how you would tell such, from any other particular sets of bits of functionality?\"\r\n\r\nBecause the bits and functionality ARE the qualia, so I tell by looking at the bits and functionality, and seeing if they are equivalent. If you can have the same functionality and behavior, but still have inverted or missing qualia, THEN that qualia MUST be epiphenomenal. In which case, I argue that they don\'t really exist. \r\n\r\n\"And what might the bits/functitonality be, which I\'d need to duplicate in your mind for you to experience my redness, if you have never experienced my redness before in your life...?\"\r\n\r\nWhatever bits produce the qualia in your brain, I reproduce them, and walla, the same CLAIMS of qualia, the same BELIEFS of qualia, the same MEMORIES of qualia, and thus... the same FEELINGS of qualia. \r\n\r\n\"Also, Material Property Dualism basically predicts that, like there are a finite number of atomic elements, there is likely a finite number of possible fundamental quale. (thought they can obviously be put together to make or paint an infinite number of diverse experiences.) But your theory predicts there would be an infinite number of possible fundamental qualia, only bounded by the complexity of the machine?\"\r\n\r\nYes, my theory predicts a countably infinite number of qualia, while yours predicts a finite number of qualia. Thus, the universe will be a FAR more interesting place to be if I am right than if you are. \r\n\r\n\"It sure would be great to get Dr. Dennett\'s take on all this to see if he sees things the same way.\"\r\n\r\nIf we write good camp statements, with GOOD references, then he might be more interested in joining in the conversation.

So on the one hand I understand the brain to be this physical object which can be measured and quantified. I picture it as a type of complex computer which has inputs, processes and outputs, all of which are causally determined and explicable. I think there are aspects of this complex computer which directly correlate with conscious experience, but are not one and the same as it. For example, when reflecting nostalgically on a happy memory, the warm feeling one gets is very much real and physical in one sense - in that your brain may be in a state of releasing oxytocin in certain pertinent areas or what have you - but in another sense, there is something else there which the purely neurophysiological description does not capture, and that is the feeling itself. \r\n\r\nAnother way of relating this paradigm is as follows: A blind man dedicates half of his life studying advanced level optics, gaining a more thorough understanding of the physics and processes of how light works than perhaps anyone else. He then spends the remaining half of his life taking on the study of neuroscience to a similarly high level - by now maybe you guess the blind man is trying to gain an understanding of what it is like to have visual experience for himself.But try as he might, and though he studies every day and attains a great deal of knowledge, at the end of the it all he lies in his deathbed feeling only as though he has led his life in vein (probably wishing he\'d dedicated all his braininess to neuprosthesis research), for he still does not have the first clue what it is like to see. \r\n\r\nThis thing, this \'what it is like\' which is not captured by any physical model, no matter how granular, is how I define qualia. Another way to illustrate the presence of some logical dichotomy between that and the physical stuff we can model is by applying the method of radical doubt. Our knowledge about the objective existence of things we perceive may be subject to doubt, as shown by the dream argument and many others. Since the brain has been identified - ultimately - through the senses, it is an objective which model may be subject to some doubt. However, we can\'t doubt that experiences themselves exist, clearly. So therefore, the more certain and intimate knowledge we have about the subjective aspects of our experience is an indicator of a distinction between those and the physical systems which we associate with them.

If we define \"learning\" as a change in neural patterns, then Mary learns something, because brain region 2 changes when she first sees color. But those changes are completely predictable form the information she had stored in brain region 1. It is this separation in how we store information that makes it SEEM like there is something \"else\" that Mary learns, and that makes qualia appear \"magical\" and which makes the explanitory gap APPEAR wide. However, if you conclude from this that qualia are epiphenomenal, as does Jackson, you jump off a rather deep cliff into stupidity.

What YOU know and understand is what matters. \n\nNow, your question, does my upload have my qualia. You say that we can\'t know that, but *I* say that we can.\n\nFor me the answer to this question (will my upload have my qualia) is quite simple. Answer the following questions: \n\n1. Does it have my behavior?\n2. Does it have my behavior FOR THE SAME REASONS. \n\nIf the answer to these two questions is yes, then it has my qualia. And I am sure that it does. Why? Because if it didn\'t, then the qualia that it doesn\'t have aren\'t up the causal chain of my behavior. THEREFORE they are epiphenomenal qualia, and I don\'t care about them anyway, and neither should you (see: http://lesswrong.com/lw/pn/zombies_the_movie/). \n\nI say \"I see red\" BECAUSE I see red. And I claim \"that experience was moving\" BECAUSE of the moving experience, in other words, because of the qualia. So whatever my subjective experience of seeing red is, however it happens, it MUST be somewhere up the causal chain of my statement \"I see red\". ANY qualia NOT up that causal chain, are qualia that I don\'t really remember, believe, and claim to have. How do I know this? Because belief has neural correlates... so if qualia CAUSES a belief that I have qualia, it has to move neurons around. Thus, the qualia that I believe that I have must be up the causal chain of whatever moved my neurons around. The same for memories, AND for claims. Anything not in the causal chain is epiphenomenal... and the causal chain in its entirety is simulatable on a computer. \n\nQualia are the experiences that I \"believe\" that I have, that I \"remember\" having had, and that I \"claim\" to have. THOSE are the qualia that I care about, and those are the qualia that I KNOW will be preserved if I preserve the causal chain. So I KNOW that my uploaded self will have my qualia, because it will have my causal chain. WHERE EVER qualia live, they MUST be in that chain somewhere. Since the chain is preserved, the qualia must be as well. \n\nQED','2012-06-07 19:18:57','2012-06-07 19:18:57'),(1901,116,44,'\r\nTheoreticians,\r\n\r\nI indicated earlier, that I had a question for Steven Lehar.

How about this formulation?:\r\n\r\n* Is it in any way theoretically possible to have full ineffable classical qualia (i.e. implying there is an â€˜explanatory gapâ€™â€¦), as defined in Property Dualism, that is both not epiphinominal (i.e. it is objectively or causally detectible) and it also does not expand the known laws of causal physics.\r\n\r\nI have in my mind how something can fit all the above constraints, but since I donâ€™t know enough about neurons, gestalt, and wave theory, and such, Iâ€™m having troubles coming up with any specific theoretical example to prove it is possible, and enable James to stop working on his I believe to be futile effort to find his proof that it isnâ€™t possible.\r\n\r\nSo, thatâ€™s my question to you Steve.  Any idea how all the above constraints might be met, given what you know of neurons, wave theory, gestalt, and all that?\r\n\r\nSteve, basically, this is the question of what happens when we start replacing neurons, one at a time, with simulated equivalents/transducers?

Iâ€™ve been working on another way to describe all this, along the lines youâ€™re talking about, so let me see if this way of thinking about it helps.\r\n\r\nAs you indicated, with computer knowledge, there is no phenomenal â€˜seemingâ€™, just abstract information which doesnâ€™t accurately represent its referent.  But the important fact is, you must have something that is the incorrect â€˜seemingâ€™, you canâ€™t just pretend it doesnâ€™t exist, or that it isnâ€™t needed, to have knowledge of any kind.\r\n\r\nMaterial Property Dualism predicts nature has both of the following real fundamental natures:\r\n\r\n* Fundamental Causal Properties.\r\n* Fundamental Phenomenal Qualities.\r\n\r\nCausal Properties include any properties like those the surface of a strawberry has, in that it causes light to reflect in a particular pattern and wavelength.  Phenomenal qualities are a categorically different fundamental nature, and include qualities such as redness or a red quale.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider abstracted information, like ones and zeros, we must realize that such isnâ€™t anything real.  Such is merely a label we apply to fundamental natures.  For example, a fundamental causal property like +5 volts can be given the abstracted label of â€˜oneâ€™.  Magnetic flux, of a particular orientation on a hard disk, can also be given the same abstracted label of one.  These abstracted ones and zeros donâ€™t exist anywhere in computers; they are just the abstracted symbols we are giving to the various fundamental things that are being interpreted as representing them, so we can better think about what is going on in a more abstracted or higher level way.\r\n\r\nIt is intuitive for us to tend to think of redness as this same kind of abstracted information.  We tend to label the surface of the strawberry as having redness; we tend to label 650 NM light as having a redness quality, and so on, just as we do when we think of abstracted ones and zeros in a computer.\r\n\r\nBut Material Property Dualism predicts this naÃ¯ve way of modeling fundamental natures is mistaken.  Redness is not some abstracted not real label we can simply apply to anything, no matter what its properties or qualities might be like.  Redness is fundamental and more real than voltages or magnetic flux.  A redness quality can be interpreted has having an abstract label, like one, or the abstracted word â€˜redâ€™, but such an abstracted label is not real, while a redness quality itself is at least as fundamentally real as any other fundamental causal property.\r\n\r\nJames is arguing that what Dr. Dennett really means, when he says we donâ€™t have fundamental phenomenal qualities, â€œit just seems like we do.â€ Is really something more like â€œwe are mistaken to think the knowledge we do have is anything more than this kind of abstracted informationâ€.

Here is what it literally sounds like you are saying when I read your question:\n\nShannon\'s information theory states that abstract information cannot exist without a physical representation. Brains process information. One example of brains processing information is when we have an experience that seems real. It follows that humans must have physical brains, not just abstract ones. We theorize that if we cut open someone\'s skull, we will find a real physical brain, except perhaps in the case of Dr. Dennett.\n\nOf course, I know that is not what you meant. So, here is what I (currently) honestly think you are trying to say:\n\nShannon\'s information theory states that abstract information cannot exist without a physical representation. We take it for granted that whenever a phenomenal experience seems to be real, information has been processed by a brain. It follows that brains must use something physical to represent phenomenal experiences. We call this \'phenomenal information\'.\n\nHere is a list of unacceptable flying leaps that I made in the preceding paragraph. (I acknowledge that this is a straw-man attack, so I will refer to the flying leaps as my own, rather than as yours.)\n\n# The relationship between abstract information and experiences-that-seem-real is not obvious. If I take this relationship for granted, without giving additional explanation, I have lost my reader already.\n# I did not explain why abstract information is insufficient to represent phenomenal-experiences-that-seem-real. Without such an explanation, there is no need to suppose that phenomenal information is needed. This would be a significant oversight when addressing Daniel Dennett, because he believes that abstract information is sufficient to represent experiences-that-seem-real.\n# I falsely assumed that phenomenal information is also subject to Shannon\'s information theory. Shannon\'s information theory only characterizes abstract information. If abstract information is not sufficient to represent experiences-that-seem-real, and phenomenal information is sufficient to represent experiences-that-seem-real, then it follows that abstract information and phenomenal information have different properties. It is a fallacy, therefore, to use Shannon\'s information theory to conclude that phenomenal information requires a physical representation.\n\nHere is what I derive from Shannon\'s information theory about consciousness. Perhaps you could morph this fit with your philosophy, or else try to articulate precisely where are philosophies diverge:\n\nShannon\'s information theory states that abstract information cannot exist without a physical representation. Neuroscientists use the term \'neural correlate\' to refer to the physical representation of the information in our brains. By definition, a neural correlate is sufficient to represent everything that the brain knows or thinks to be true or real. All beliefs, therefore, can be explained by a neural correlate. Although phenomenal experiences seem real, no quantifiable evidence has ever been found to suggest that phenomenal experiences are more than a belief. Therefore, electrostatic signals, synaptic potentials, and various chemicals are probably sufficient to constitute a neural correlate. Since all such things can be simulated, it follows that beliefs (including the belief that some specific phenomenal experience was real) consist of nothing more than abstract information represented by a neural correlate. It also follows that the reason qualia are so difficult to express (a.k.a. the quale interpretation problem) is because qualia are imaginary.\n\n','2012-06-13 18:24:15','2012-06-13 18:24:15'),(1931,96,48,'Reply to Mike Gashler:\r\n\r\nIn a good faith attempt to be helpful, let me try to explain.\r\n\r\nThere is one central sticking point that causes confusion on this issue that some people just don\'t \"get\" no matter how many times it is explained.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between abstract information and experiences-that-seem-real is *perfectly* obvious once you acknowledge that the red bulgy thing that you take to be the strawberry, is not the strawberry itself, but is a replica of the strawberry in your brain. The real strawberry is out in the world beyond possible experience.\r\n\r\nIn information-theoretic terms, it does not even matter whether the strawberry actually exists, your experience can be a dream or hallucination of a strawberry, and the information content of that experienced strawberry is expressed as the red bulgy patch in your experience.\r\n\r\nThis is analogous to viewing a strawberry indirectly, on a television monitor connected to a remote camera in front of the strawberry. The information content of that strawberry is a red patch on the screen shaped like a 2-D projection of a strawberry.\r\n\r\nDennetts objection is that there is no red bulgy thing in your experience, that red bulgy thing is the strawberry itself, and my experience of that strawberry is an abstract thought such as \"there\'s a strawberry!\".  Its as if Dennet were objecting that there is no red patch on the screen because he believes the screen to be an open window providing a direct view of the strawberry itself, so he believes the redness is a property of its surface, not of the glowing pixels on the TV monitor.\r\n\r\nThat is why Dennett complains that there is no such thing as experience as such, the qualia are merely a property of the object itself, viewed directly where it lies out in the world.\r\n\r\nOnce you recognize that the television picture is a replica of the strawberry, you can distinguish between the redness on the screen, and the redness of the original strawberry that it attempts to duplicate in effigy.\r\n\r\nAnd likewise, taking another step backwards, once you realize that the red bulgy thing that looks so much like a strawberry, is a patch of red \"experience\" inside your brain, which is distinct from the strawberry itself, which you cannot see directly, and which may or may not actually exist.\r\n\r\nThe information of experience is expressed as modulations of the qualia across space and time, i.e. where you see the strawberry, your brain has painted a red quale in the shape of a strawberry, and the abstract information \"there\'s a strawberry!\" is separate and distinct from the red bulgy thing that you may or may not recognize as a strawberry.\r\n\r\nSome people will never understand this explanation because like Dennett, they believe their experience of the world to be direct, and that is the source of the whole confusion.\r\n\r\nIf you are really interested in understanding this issue (as opposed to Dennett, who has already made up his mind and refuses to consider the alternative because it seems to him so patently absurd that it is not even a serious proposition to be considered and rejected!) read this chapter:\r\n\r\nhttp://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/book/chap1.html\r\n\r\nor read this quick illustrated summary\r\n\r\nhttp://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/epist.html\r\n\r\nor you can read the debate in cartoon form here:\r\n\r\nhttp://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/cartoonepist/cartoonepist.html\r\n\r\n  Steve Lehar\r\n\r\n','2012-06-13 20:28:27','2012-06-13 20:28:27'),(1934,96,48,'@Steve Lehar:\r\n\r\nThanks for the thoughtful and clear response. \r\n\r\nFrom what I have heard of Dennett\'s argument, he isn\'t opposed to representationalism, nor is he a naieve realist as you paint him.

The qualia are the carriers of the information of experience, and that information is expressed as the modulations of that carrier. Is that at least clear now?\n\nThis is why qualia are defined as \'ineffable\'. By analogy with a computer, the computer \"knows\" the value of a number stored as \"x = 5\", for example, but there is no way for the computer to tell me whether that value \"5\" is stored internally as a voltage in a memory register, magnetic domains on a tape or disk drive, optical pits on a DVD, or holes in a punch card. The information itself is perfectly \"effable\" from one machine to the next. What remains \"ineffable\" is the carrier itself, whose modulations express that stored information.\n\nDennett\'s interpretation of the many illusions he cites is the opposite to a representationalist interpretation. His argument is that our experience, which appears as a surrounding 3-D \"picture\" of reality, is an illusion, it only \"seems\" as if its a 3-D \"picture\", in reality it is merely a sequence of glimpses and impressions as we glance around the scene, and there is no actual \"picture\" anywhere in the brain. If you can examine the world around you and NOT see it as a 3-D \"picture\" then Dennett\'s argument is plausible. But I see a 3-D world in my experience, and I don\'t just \"seem\" to see it, I see it with such clarity and certainty that it is hard not to be fooled by the Grand Illusion and believe it to be the world itself.\n\nIn Ned Block\'s book \"Imagery\" Dennett\'s Chapter 4 is devoted to refuting the notion of mental imagery as actual \"pictures in the brain\" as follows:\n\n(quote taken from my rebuttal to reviewers\' objections here\nhttp://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw2/rebut2-2.html\nscroll down to point 14)\n\n>>>>\n\nChapter 4 is written again by Daniel Dennett. This time he \"defeats\" the notion of mental imagery by constructing a fanciful analogy. He asks the reader to imagine that anthropologists have discovered a native tribe that believes in a hitherto unheard-of God of the forest, named \"Feenoman\" (this will stand in for the supposedly fictitious \"phenomenal experience\" whose existence Dennett so forcefully denies). Some of the anthropologists begin to believe in Feenoman as an objectively real deity (the \"Feenomanists\"), while others retain their scientific rigor, and study the native religion while remaining agnostic themselves (the \"Feenomanologists\"). On page 102 Dennett concludes that:\n\n    \"Phenomenal space is Mental Image Heaven ... [mental images] can reside,\n    with Santa Claus, in the logical space of fiction.\"\n\nBut analogies only work when the analogy is analogous. In this case nobody has ever actually seen Feenoman, and therefore it is reasonable to question His existence. The phenomenal world on the other hand is right before our eyes, if only we can recognize it for what it is. Dennett\'s argument works better against mental imagery than perception, because it is easier to deny the existence of those...\n\n    \"...entirely mythical species of mental images: the various non-physical,\n    phenomenal or epiphenomenal, self-intimating, transparent to cognition,\n    unmisapprehensible, pseudo-extended, quasi-imagistic phantasms that\n    have often been presented as mental images in the past.\" (page 104)\n\nHowever this argument does not work so well against perception.

Shannon entropy is the dissipation of information processing efficiency in the context of data compression, not a general property that equates to materials involved. If information is highly compressible, ie, 10,000 zeros in a row, then it has a very low Shannon entropy - it is easy to compress and not a lot of *extra* information needs to be added on top of the text to allow the text to be reconstituted. This is the opposite of thermodynamic entropy, in which a box of half hot coals and half ice cubes has lower entropy than that same box when it has reached equilibrium as warm coal mud.\r\n\r\nThen we throw in QM and get a different idea of information...it\'s kind of a mess, and I think it takes us away from the more relevant issue of information\'s relation to consciousness and consciousness\'s relation to physics.

I believe that the most sound materialist conception of conscious experience is property dualism (and all property dualisms entail epiphenomena). So it seems, under this model, what would happen with a gradual upload is that you would gradually lose qualitative experience, but since your brain is physical, it wouldn\'t actually notice. Of course that\'s absurd. The whole notion of property dualism is absurd. \r\n\r\nBut it\'s the only materialist theory that close to makes sense. James talks about our idea of qualia arising because different parts of the brain are responsible for different types of processing, and we\'re trying to understand one in terms of the other. Fair enough. So let\'s break it down. \r\n\r\nOne proposes a material, physical computational machine such as the brain, which is capable of receiving dynamic inputs which inform it in its own language about the world - it then responds to the information appropriately, all in a pretty deterministic framework. (I\'m no neuroscientist and maybe some of you are, but this is accurate, no?). \r\n\r\nNow, if you are a materialist, that is pretty much how you\'ve got to model the brain. It doesn\'t matter that you are forming that conception in one part of your brain, and doing the experiencing in the other - the fact is, if you\'re a materialist you have got to have real belief in your model. The model you have is an objective one. Qualitative experience doesn\'t fit in with that model, and it\'s nothing to do with brain areas or what have you. The very act of making and understanding a physical model has a qualitative aspect, and is anyone going to tell me that I\'m experiencing that model in a different part of the brain from the one I\'m making it in? Hello infinite regress.\r\n\r\nNo matter what you say, as long as you\'re only explaining qualia in terms of its physical neural correlates, you\'ve always got to state (implicitly or explicitly) that qualia are a *property* of those correlates, and that is exactly what property dualism is.','2012-06-13 23:11:53','2012-06-13 23:11:53'),(1958,96,48,'@Multisense, you wrote: \"That\'s what I was explaining. Shannon entropy sees uniformity and equilibrium as a low entropy state, and physics entropy sees uniformity and equilibrium as the high energy state.\"\r\n\r\nThis misunderstands what is going on here I think. \r\n\r\nLet\'s start with entropy from physics. Boltzman\'s definition of entropy is \"Entropy is a measure of the number of particular microscopic arrangements of atoms that appear indistinguishable from a macroscopic perspective.\" In other words, it involves our \"uncertainty\" with regard to the potential arrangements of atoms given our macroscopic measurement. In Gibbs\' formulation, entropy is explicitly a measure of what we know. \"We could choose to think of entropy as characterizing what we know about the state. In the Boltzmann way of thinking about entropy, the knowledge of which macrostate we are in tells us less and less about the microstate as entropy increases; the Gibbs approach inverts this perspective and defines entropy in terms of how much we know. Instead of starting with a course-graining on the space of states, we start with a probability distribution; the percentage chance, for each possible microstate, that the system is actually in that microstate right now. Then Gibbs gives us a formula, analogous to Boltzmann\'s, for calculating the entropy associated with that probability distribution.\" Coarse-graining never comes into the game.\" (Sean Carroll \"From Eternity to Here\" p. 170.) Incidentally, his formula just happens to be identical to Shannon\'s formula. \r\n\r\n\"Shannon entropy would not change based on the degree of certainty that any particular observer/receiver of information\"\r\n\r\nActually it does. The formulas are identical, and informational entropy IS a measure of uncertainty. To see how this relates to compression, understand, if I can predict the value of the bits in an information stream, then I can encode it such that the more common values have the shortest encoding length, and the less common values have the longer encoding lengths (I can do far better than that actually, but this will give you the intuitive connection between entropy, uncertainty, and compressability). It turns out that the compressability of a data stream is related to your uncertainty about the values of the data stream in a manner related to the formula we call \"entropy\". (To understand this mathematically, read Cover and Thomas\'s \"Elements of Information Theory\"). \r\n\r\nNote here that in both cases, the entropy is a measure of \"uncertainty\", and that the formula for that uncertainty is naturally the same. Now take a look at Jaynes book Probability Theory, the Logic of Science (available online here: http://omega.albany.edu:8008/JaynesBook.html). He shows that entropy is the only measure of uncertainty that is consistent, and that matches a set of \"common sense\" axioms. He actually derives Shannon entropy FROM these axioms. \r\n\r\nIf you add to that what Hawking radiation says about entropy, information, and black holes, and add the holographic principle, and then add the Maxwell\'s demon thought experiment, where we learn that information carries energy (which solves the Maxwell\'s demon paradox), and if you assume that E=mc^2, then WALLA, you realize that information is quite closely tied to what we call \"matter\" and \"energy\" in a rather tight fashion. It does indeed appear that it is impossible for information to be carried without there being energy and/or mass associated with the information.\r\n\r\nIn other words, there appears to be no such thing as immaterial information. \r\n\r\nAnd we can go one step further: \"[Because of] digital communication in the last 25 or 30 years, physicists, many physicists, especially those dealing with quantum mechanics and cosmology, have come to believe that the universe itself is actually made out of information, and that every object in the universe, including you and me, every object is made out of information, and the interaction of the information within our bodies, and the interaction of the information exchanged between our bodies and the world actually explains who we are, and what we are, and what we are capable of doing.\" \r\n(Professor Terrell Ward Bynum, Director, Research Center on Computing and Society, Southern Connecticut State University).  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=pMh8oBdKkK4#!','2012-06-14 00:08:44','2012-06-14 00:08:44'),(1961,96,48,'@jcarroll Let\'s put this in common sense terms.\r\n\r\nThere is no measure of particular microscopic arrangements of atoms that applies to the McDonalds logo. The McDonalds logo is information, and it can exist in any visual medium on any scale or number of atoms.\r\n\r\nGolden arches built out of titanium steel allow 500 feet tall are going to require much more physical work to make indistinguishable from the macroscopic view of it\'s context than would a small drawing made with colored pencil.\r\n\r\nShannon entropy says to me that the description of the golden arches logo - at any size or material composition, can be mathematically compressed as a single parabola repeated, a color value, and some other custom details. Since the vector-based compression would be faster and less resource intensive than say a bitmap of the whole logo, the vector compression has lower entropy - less drag on the process.\r\n\r\nI don\'t think that there can be any distinction between microcosmic and macrocosmic levels of description in the context of claiming an objective property. If you mean uncertainty, then why say entropy? We may be unable to distinguish the differences between atomic states but that doesn\'t imply that we are uncertain. To the contrary, we are certain that there is no distinction at the macrocosmic level. If microcosmic differences were to enter into the macrocosm, it would be noise.\r\n\r\nBoltzmann\'s ideas are interesting, but I see them as related to the transition between levels, or what I am calling castes of perceptual relativity. Entropy in the Boltzmann sense seems to refer to the loss of perceptual integrity when the range of observable castes of the object moves further to the periphery of the subject\'s detectable range of castes, so that there is less overlap.\r\n\r\nI posted an idea today about this, and how it relates to qualia and quanta: http://s33light.org/post/25044974260\r\n\r\nI appreciate your taking the time to try to educate me on the current state of information theory. It is interesting for me to learn about it, but I feel that my ideas (and I recognize exactly how deluded this sounds) pick up where our current popular theories leave off - only I am not building my ideas from the present and moving forward, I am stabbing at the future and working my way back, and (again not to sound like the very stereotype of crackpot) I think it\'s working. I don\'t have the skills to tie up all of the connections with every intellectual school in existence, but I am confident that those who really understand the core principles of my ideas will be able to if they choose to make the effort.\r\n\r\n\"The formulas are identical, and informational entropy\r\nIS a measure of uncertainty\"\r\n\r\nIf I close my eyes, I become uncertain of the optical environment outside of my head, yes? What entropy is increased for other people in the room?\r\n\r\nIn physical entropy, if an ice cube melts, it melts for everyone who experiences it. Opening your eyes doesn\'t make the ice melt slower.\r\n\r\nI feel like contemporary informaiton theory is wayyy too navel gazing and has lost all contact with the realities of either physics or consciousness. It is a purely syntactic echo chamber that is approaching angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin levels of esoterica. It\'s great for computation, but just as \"the knowledge of which macrostate we are in tells us less and less about the microstate as entropy increases\", it is clear to me that the more knowledge of which information process we are using, the less and less we know about the semantic reality which those processes pertain to.\r\n\r\nAs for uncertainty and compression, I can see, for example how there is a tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols, with the former being a broadcast protocol that is cheap and buggy but useful where you have large data streams that can tolerate a lot of missing bits, and the latter having transmission control and error correction. This inversely related quantity vs quality principle I think ties into my \'full spectrum\' information theory, but to say that entropy is strictly tied to uncertainty I think is a bias of computation and not experience. For a human mind, uncertainty can be a teleological attractor, a problem to solve, or a hunch to explore...the opposite of entropy and surrender to the forces of inevitable decay.\r\n\r\nI agree with you completely that there is no such thing as immaterial information, because I don\'t think there is any such thing as information at all. It is a way of undertstanding common sense on a low caste, and therefore horizontally pervasive level. From that level however, no higher caste experience can be reconstituted without that higher caste encoding the text to begin with. Low level carriers of information would never evolve vertically to higher castes on their own. The universe is not information.

If there is anything (information, experience, or anything else) in the first person perspective that isn\'t COMPLETELY deducible by the third person observation, then that \"extra\" stuff must be epiphenomenal, and thus not really exist (or if it does, then I don\'t care about it, and neither should you). \r\n\r\n\"I suggest reading the famous Thomas Nagel paper \'What is it like to be a bat?\' for some insight on that.\"\r\n\r\nI have read it, and find it completely non-convincing. \r\n\r\nThe problem for me is the problem of epiphenomenalism. Any \"extra\" stuff must be epiphenomenal almost by definition. But my consciousness is causally active. The conscious experience that needs to be explained is all causal consciousness. So any proposed extra stuff must not be where my consciousness comes from... the result? Consciousness must be fully explainable from the third person perspective through a reductionist approach with the laws of physics. \r\n\r\nConclusion: Consciousness must be an emergent phenomenon of the causal laws of physics. \r\n\r\nI am well aware that this conclusion is counter-intuitive. But lots of reality is counter intuitive. That doesn\'t make it less true. ','2012-06-14 17:58:11','2012-06-14 17:58:11'),(1994,96,48,'Reply to James:\r\n\r\nThanks for the thoughtful reply. I think I have an idea of where you are coming from now. Basically, you are saying that, while property dualism seems intuitive, it leads to obviously erroneous beliefs such as epiphenomenalism. Now, I don\'t necessarily see the immediate problem with epiphenomena, but I do agree that property dualism as a whole leads to many paradoxes. For example, if qualia are fundamental properties of all particles, how do they get synthesised up in to experience? In real life, in the \'world out there\' picture of things, there is not really any such thing as an \'object\'. There are just bundles of fundamental particles which just happen to be coming together as a result of various forces acting upon them. Unless I have it all wrong (possible), fundamental particles don\'t communicate with each other. So how is it, I ask again, that qualia get built up in to continuous whole entities, when their physical correlates are often discrete or even disparate? Well I reckon that\'s one problem with property dualism. \r\n\r\nI suppose epiphenomena do create issues in a way, because the question arises \'How would ever know about them in the first place if they are non-causal?â€™ So yeah, I agree, I see some logical problems with property dualism, and have done since the idea first came to me. If you look in the camp about 5th dimensional consciousness - that was my first attempt at a solution. I tried to resolve the first problem by postulating that the seat of consciousness was in the electromagnetic field of the brain, and hence could be continuous. But I think now that was a little bold, since I don\'t know much beyond high school physics about EM fields (and knew even less then). I also had no solution to the epiphenomenal problem. Getting back on track though, let me consider the alternative to property dualism which you seem to propose.\r\n\r\nUnless I am mistaken, you are in agreement with the Dan Dennett quotation which everyone is getting themselves worked up about on this thread, right? Well, I have a problem with that statement too. There are two ways I could interpret it, and I\'d like to know which interpretation best fits your own. The first has \'seeming\' to be an objective notion, along the lines of what someone else here talked about, i.e. a database reference. Here our idea of having qualia simply comes from our thought processes becoming confused and over-analysing the sensory ones, but in reality nothing weird or different like subjective experience is actually going on. I think this would be the perfect theory if we were actually robots studying the denizens of this little forum, wondering what in the devil they were on about. But Iâ€™m not a robot, and whether or not I analyse anything, I am always aware of experiencing things, and having feelings. And I donâ€™t really see how a simple one off causal process could give rise to this whole notion of subjective experience. I think itâ€™s fair to say that you donâ€™t need to have read David Chalmers in order to have qualia â€“ and I seriously doubt anyone here is asserting that the vast majority of the human population are nothing more than philosophical zombies, or functionalist machines. In a lot of ways, I donâ€™t think that argument makes much sense â€“ youâ€™ve got to be â€˜awareâ€™ of your thoughts and cognitive processes for it to begin to work, for example, which would be entirely circular. The second notion is one that has been argued against in this thread before, where â€˜seemsâ€™ is simply interpreted as a subjective experience from the get go, and the argument is immediately seen as circular. Essentially the two positions are equivalent, but I entertained the first idea for a little while and was almost convinced by it before I realised that both interpretation were logically equivalent. \r\n\r\nI know my argument isnâ€™t following a very precise train right now, but the concepts are difficult. I am just curious as to what mechanism you suggest for qualia coming about without ever including any non-physical components. I think itâ€™s impossible, because as soon as you allow for qualia - illusion or otherwise - you have allowed for a subjective experience, which is different entirely from objective existence and therefore dualistic. \r\nBrent is aware that I have proposed to start a solipsism camp, but I donâ€™t think it would be very popular here. Essentially though, thatâ€™s where all of my thoughts are leading me. \r\n','2012-06-15 07:52:32','2012-06-15 07:52:32'),(1997,96,48,'Theoreticians,\n\nMike [http://canonizer.com/thread.asp/88/1/32/79#79 said] he has been working very long and hard but still failing to understand this trivial and easy statement:\n\n    \"If you know something, there must be something that is this knowledge\"\n\nTo which James agrees, saying such is [http://canonizer.com/thread.asp/88/1/32/80#80 \"not clear at all\"].\n\nYou guys are making this WAY too hard.  If a computer program does something, you must have written code to make it do what it is doing, and there must be some fundamental natures of reality that is configured so that it can be interpreted as the abstract label that is the information you programmed.

If you know something, there must be something physically real that is able to be that knowledge.\n\nWhat I hear you guys  saying is: you can get our redness and greenness seemings, without them being anything fundamentally real.  Which is completely absurd to property dualists that experience classical qualia.\n\nDr. Dennett says we don\'t have qualia: \"It just seems like we do\".  Even you guys can see what an obvious mistake this is.\n\nSo, to try to preserve your, to me, absurd theories, you end up making an even worse mistake by saying our seeming, itself is what is mistaken.  In other words, you are saying we have redness and greenness seemings, but we are mistaken to think these are the absolute fundamental qualities they are.  You are claiming, despite what we absolutely experience them as, they are nothing more than meaningless, unreal, abstracted information, mere labels we give to various fundamental causal properties, like ones and zeros.\n\nRedness and Greenness, are what they are.  I, at least, know that more absolutely than we know anything else science has taught us.  I seriously doubt that you guys know this, like I do, for if you did, it would be trivially easy for you to understand all this.

The problem with epiphenomenalism, is it isn\'t observable or testable, or effable.  Even if epiphenomenal qualia did exist, like invisible unicorns, why would anyone care, even if they did, since nobody can provide any evidence that they do exist.  (for a very comical illustration of how absurd epiphenomenalism is see [http://lesswrong.com/lw/pn/zombies_the_movie/ \"Zombies: The Movie\"].\n\nThere are no such problems with macro material property dualism, that simply predicts there are two categorically different types of fundamental natures to reality:\n\n* Causal Properties\n* Phenomenal Qualities\n\nWhich are simply both different fundamental natures of the same physical things.  The only difference is how you are observing / experiencing them.  They don\'t, as Jordan said: \"get synthesized up in to experience\", they are simply fundamental natures of reality our brain paints our conscious knowledge with.  The testable prediction is there is something in nature that has these qualities.  An idealized theoretical example being the neuro transmitter Glutamate has a phenomenal redness quality and Aspartate has a greenness quality.  When neurons want to paint a strawberry in our consciousness, it fires with Glutamate.  When it paints the leaves - Aspartate.  Just because all of our only cause and effected based scientific instruments can \'see\' of glutamate, are its causal properties, doesn\'t mean that they also can\'t have ineffable qualities that simply suffer from the quale interpretation problem, making them ineffable.\n\nObviously, if science bears out Material Property Dualism, and we finally eff to you guys that have no idea what my redness is like, and you never find some other way to get redness, without glutamate, you guys must admit how wrong you guys were, right?

Yes. I am asserting that all humans are all functionalist machines. I think that is what Dennett is ultimately saying too (although perhaps he is wise enough to avoid saying it directly).

I do not require a fully-developed argument, just something worth pondering for a while--something we can ask Daniel Dennett about--something that is not ultimately based on a circular testimony of how real our experiences seem to be.\r\n\r\nBut I am increasingly convinced that no such argument exists. Dennett has correctly identified the root of the issue. The only basis to suggest that we are anything more than functionalist machines is that our experiences \'just seem real\', and every explanation for this phenomenon involving magic can be restated without the magical component with no reduction in the quality of the explanation. Representationalism is the perfect example of this. It is a pretty good explanation for experiences, but it explains experience *JUST AS WELL* with all non-functionalist components removed.

It has nothing to do with how real we feel our experience to be, but the fact that it is possible to conceive of even the hint of the possibility of \'real\' is 100% impossible in a functionalist universe.

I claim that there must be no difference between subjective experiences and objective reality, or else you produce epiphenomenalism. So subjective experiences must be equivalent to objective states through a STRONG equivalence principle. Anything weakly connecting them (like property dualism) produces a belief that subjective experience and behavior have a shared cause, That isn\'t good enough, the experience must cause the behavior, not just share a cause with the behavior. \r\n\r\n\"Now, I don\'t necessarily see the immediate problem\r\nwith epiphenomena\"\r\n\r\nWell, I say \"I see red\" because I experience the qualia of red. The qualia CAUSES the response. It doesn\'t share a common cause with the response, it directly causes the response. Let\'s assume that sex carries an epiphenomenal qualia of intense pain, while stabbing yourself in the hand with a knife has the epiphenomenal qualia of intense pleasure. How would you refute this claim to reversed epiphenomenal qualia? You would still say \"OH YES\" when having sex and \"OH NO\" whne stabbing yourself in the hand with a knife. You say \"well, I don\'t FEEL or BELIEVE that I have these reversed qualia form the first person perspective\" but your beliefs involve third person states in your brain, and so a belief about a qualia must come form the causal properties of the qualia, not its epiphenomenal properties, so not believing that these \"reversed\" epiphenomenal qualia exist from the first person perspective is no proof that they don\'t. \r\n\r\nIn other words, people have assumed that the first person perspective somehow provides a window into the non-objective epiphenomenal world. But this isn\'t true. If something has no causal properties, then it can\'t affect the neural correlates. And we know that first person experiences come with neural correlates. And that means that an epiphenomenal experience of red can\'t cause your claims of seeing red (that would make it causal) nor can it affect your beliefs (because it can\'t create or even effect the neural correlates that accompany that belief without being causal), and it can\'t affect your feelings (because it can\'t create the neural correlates without being causal).\r\n\r\nBut what if there was a shared cause between the experience and the causal acts. Let\'s call this shared cause the \"source\". Now the source causes the epiphenomenal experience of red, and it causes you to say \"I see red\". This is essentially what Chalmers proposes. But now, if we think about it, it is the source that is causing the claim, the belief, and the feeling, NOT the epiphenomenal qualia themselves. You could cut these qualia out of the equation entirely, and you would not change your claims, beliefs, and feelings! \r\n\r\nIn other words, epiphenomenal qualia are irrelevant, and aren\'t the subjective experiences that so desperately need to be explained. \r\n\r\nBrent and others have claimed that there is a way to produce a theory of property dualism that is not epiphenomenal. I have challenged them to write out such a theory formally in terms of random variables and their effect on other random variables  (like a Baysian Network), such that the final random variable (behavior) is directly causally linked to the phenomenal properties, in such a way that doesn\'t just turn the phenomenal properties back into fundamental causal laws of physics. So far, no one has met this challenge, while I have produced a similar network for PD that makes them epiphenomenal (the phenomenal random variables aren\'t directly linked to behavior). See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxzSyLAj3NI. Until someone meets this challenge, I can\'t believe in PD. \r\n\r\n@Brent: \r\n\r\n\"Mike said[1] he has been working very long and hard but still failing to understand this trivial and easy statement:\"\r\n\r\nWhen taking criticism of your writing, you don\'t get to claim that it is simple, easy, or clear. The point of communication is to produce a statement that is simple or clear to someone ELSE, not one that is simple or clear to the speaker. We all know what we mean, so what we say is clear to us. But that doesn\'t make it clear to someone else. \r\n\r\nAt this point, I do think that I know what you mean, but this understanding didn\'t come from your statement. It came form other conversations with you about what that statement was supposed to mean. And that means that the statement on its own is still unclear, and will likely not be understood by others (or by Dennett if you send it to him). Which just means that you need to work harder at making the thought clearer and more easily understood. \r\n\r\nI don\'t think that means that I am making it \"way too hard\", I think that it means that you still aren\'t communicating your thoughts effectively. \r\n\r\n\"Redness and Greenness, are what they are.

To test for this, can you guys answer a question for me: What is the difference between a real red quale, and your memory of the same (what you remember of quale, when your eyes are closed.) Perhaps your redness is more like my mere memory of redness?\"\r\n\r\nYou often make this claim that my experiences must not be as real as yours, or I would obviously believe what you beleive, but I just don\'t think so. My experiences are intense. I can\'t even begin to explain the difference between my imagination of red, and my experience of red, but there is a BIG difference. Red is real. Red FEELS fundamental. I admit as much as the next guy that this all FEELS fundamental, rich, and irreducible. But I also know that reality is often counter intuitive. The problem is that qualia can\'t be fundamental without being epiphenomenal... and I know that my qualia aren\'t epiphenomenal every bit as much as I know that they FEEL fundamental. I know for 100% certain that my experiences, whatever they are, and wherever they come from, affect my behavior. If any theory that makes them fundamental makes them epiphenomenal, then they can\'t be fundamental, they must just SEEM that way. You claim that\'s not true, that they can be fundamental and not be epiphenomenal... fine... show me. I WANT my experiences to be fundamental. That would be FAR more intuitively pleasing. But I am convinced that it can\'t be done without epiphenomenalism. So continuing to argue that experiences just feel so darn real/fundamental won\'t change my mind. I already agree that they feel that way. If you want to change my mind, then you need to produce an example of a formal system where experience is causally active, but not just another fundamental property of causal physics. You don\'t even have to produce the \"right\" system, just an example to show that some consistent and reasonable system for non epiphenomenal fundamental qualia might exist somewhere out there. \r\n\r\n\"There are no such problems with macro material property dualism\"\r\n\r\nBull feces, you read my paper draft, I already showed that this isn\'t true. MPD leads to epiphenomenalism. If you think otherwise, show me. You write: \r\n\r\n\"\r\n * Causal Properties\r\n * Phenomenal Qualities\r\n Which are simply both different fundamental natures of the same physical things.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, they share a common SOURCE. Thus, the phenomenal properties are epiphenomenal. They don\'t directly effect the causal properties... of if they do, then suddenly they aren\'t different form the causal properties... it\'s one or the other, either the phenomenal properties are just causal properties, nothing more.... or else they are epiphenomenal. Either way, your causally active experience would arise as an emergent property of the causal properties alone, while your epiphenomenal experience would arise form teh phenomenal properties. \r\n\r\n\"An idealized theoretical example being the neuro transmitter Glutamate has a phenomenal redness quality and Aspartate has a greenness quality.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is the CAUSAL properties of your Glutamate and Aspartate that carry their causal effects. So any additional properties of Glutamate or Aspartate must be epiphenomenal properties. It\'s their causal properties that \"paint\" our active experience, because they also paint their causal activity in the brain, and thus their behavior producing properties, like claiming \"I see red\" or \"I see green\". \r\n\r\n\"Obviously, if science bears out Material Property Dualism, and we finally eff to you guys that have no idea what my redness is like, and that there is no other way to get redness, without glutamate, you guys must admit how worn you guys were, when we finally can eff to you what my redness is like right?

That is where I disagree with you, I don\'t think it is the subjective component of experience which does that at all. It is the firing of neurons which causes one action or another, and nothing more. My idea of qualia, or epiphenomena, is similar to Brent\'s Fundamental Phenomenal Properties (which is why I think Brent\'s idea of epiphenomena is different than mine). The idea is that you have fully causal physical processes which can be detected externally, and there is some qualitative aspect of those physical processes, which - it would appear - are consistent in their experienced quality with their functional role. But the experienced quality (the epiphenomenon, the quale, the raw feel) has no causal role. Taking away the causal role of subjective experience isn\'t particularly harmful, because we\'re saying (or *I\'m* saying, I don\'t know what other people think) that the quality of the subjective experience is \'as a result of\' its neural-functional correlate. Pain always feels painful because that is exactly the way your brain treats it, and the epiphenomena are simply aspects of that neurological \'treating\'.\r\n\r\nBrent, you see an issue with epiphenomena in that they can\'t be empircally verified.

But that doesn\'t really make any sense, because the test subject giving that response would be well covered by the fundamental causal properties of Glutamate, would it not? I can just as easily get James to program a little machine which says the word \'red\' out loud every time you type in the word \'shoe\' at an input. You\'ve still got the same problem you\'re finding in epiphenomena.

You are, in effect, seeing the neural correlates \"from the inside\" where they appear as solid volumes, bounded by colored surfaces, embedded in a spatial void.\r\n\r\nThe dualism is merely epistemological, like a television monitor that presents a copy of the scene before the camera, but the camera, monitor, and scene are all part of one physical universe.\r\n\r\nThis variation of representationalism is known as *identity theory*, i.e. the phenomenal experience is not only similar to the neural correlates, there is no distinction between them! I can say as an objective scientific FACT that a certain neural correlate in my brain IS currently RED, redness is a property of that correlate, although you have to be me to actually see that color property.\r\n\r\nI quote from my book \r\n\r\nhttp://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/book/chap1.html\r\n\r\nquote >>>\r\n\r\nIt follows therefore that a percept can be viewed in two different contexts, either from the objective external context, as a pattern of electrochemical activity in the physical brain expressed in terms of neurophysiological variables such as electrical voltages or neural spiking frequencies, and from the internal subjective context where that same percept is viewed as a subjective experience expressed in terms of subjective variables such as perceived color, shape, or motion, etc. Like the two faces of a coin, these very different entities can be identified as merely different manifestations of the same underlying structure. The dual nature of a percept is analogous to the representation of data in a digital computer, where a pattern of voltages present in a particular memory register can represent some meaningful information, either a numerical value, or a brightness value in an image, or a character of text, etc. when viewed from inside the appropriate software environment, while when viewed in external physical terms that same data takes the form of voltages or currents in particular parts of the machine. \r\n\r\n<<< quote\r\n\r\nSo for example a pattern of voltages in a computer register in this pattern \"0101\" represents the number \"5\" in binary. If you measure with a volt meter you read \"0101\". If you probe that register with software it will report the value \"5\". If you copy it onto your screen it will appear as a color, depending on what look-up table you have. The SAME DATA appear different from different perspectives, but there is one and only one register and it has the pattern \"0101\", the rest is interpretation by software depending on what you want to do with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n','2012-06-15 18:44:12','2012-06-15 18:44:12'),(2024,96,48,'@omgpop:\r\n\r\nyou wrote: \"you are saying that the qualia is what causes the action.

Material Property Dualism predicts there must be some real or basement level that everything is running on.\r\n\r\nAbstracted information can be represented by something real, like +5 and 0 volts can represent a one and zero.  This abstracted information can be interpreted at another level as numbers, like 10 and 0, which can continue up to the next layer and be 0xFF0000, and 0x00FF00, which at the next level can be interpreted as the abstract words red and green, which can be interpreted at the next layer as stop and go.  And you can design a virtual simulation to run on top of this layer where the words stop and go represent +0 volts vs +5 volts, and start they cycle over again, as many times as you want, in any way you want.  The bottom line is, all these layers are abstracted interpretations from the lower layer, by interpreting it as such.  But, ultimately, there is the real physical +5 and 0 voltages which is doing the real representation, and requires no interpretation, it just is reality and what it is like.\r\n\r\nphenomenal qualities, like causal properties, are fundamental natures of reality, they are real, they are not abstracted interpretations of other things.  They can be interpreted as \"red\" vs \"green\" which can be interpreted as stop vs go, and forever up the chain as far as you want to go - but again, at the fundamental level, there is the redness and the greenness doing the representing, and it is like something, without having to be interpreted as being such.\r\n\r\nOne type of zombie system is any system which is running on, or being simulated by, it\'s knowledge being interpreted as something other than it really is.

This is where Dennett trips up, because he claims that the \"neural vehicles\" (correlates) can have no resemblance whatsoever to their contents (the experiences), so supposedly the activation of a single neuron might represent the experience of an evening on a mountaintop at sunset! Thats absurd!\r\n\r\nPerhaps an excursion into the inanimate might clarify the issue. Have you seen a swollen stream after a big rainstorm? Have you seen the URGENCY of its gushing, the power of its determination, and the happy laughter of its many burbles and swirls and splashes, the breathless leap over a waterfall, the shattering crash at the bottom before pulling itself together again and adopting a more placid mood. Thats sure the way it looks from the *outside*. Would you deny that that water feels the passion on which it manifestly acts? Does it do all that gushing and spurting without the slightest hint of a desire, without a \"mental calculation\" deciding how much to spill this side of a rock instead of that? Is the water really a zombie, that has no awareness of its own capricious and energetic behavior? \r\n\r\nBecause if water had no awareness of its own dynamic processes, then so would we also, we would all be zombies! The very fact that I have experience tells me that a dynamic process (my mind) taking place in a physical mechanism (my brain) can under certain circumstances become conscious of its own internal dynamic processes.\r\n\r\nThe simplest, most parsimonious explanation is that all matter and energy feel the passion of their internal forces, even if they lack any memories, or aspirations, or any larger understanding of anything beyond their own selves. And the information content and computational algorithm of those physical processes is identically equal to the information content that they express by their modulations. The mind matches its neural correlate as this pattern of voltages\r\n\r\n[0, +5, 0, +5]  \r\n\r\nmatches this number\r\n\r\n[0,   1,  0, 1]\r\n\r\nbecause the number is PAINTED OUT IN VOLTAGES and thus it cannot in principle be any different than them, except their appearance, for example whether probed with a volt meter with a scale that goes to 5, or probed by a digital chip that \"reads\" that voltage as Boolean 1.\r\n\r\nThey are not two distinct entities, there is no magic involved, they are one and the same viewed from two different perspectives, and the only magic involved is the magic that makes matter and energy possible in the first place, because everything in the universe is magical, and has its own subjective perspective on the happenings in the world.\r\n\r\nThe perspective of perceptual experience is unique in that it is entirely internal to our brain, and yet it serves as a replica of external reality. Nevertheless, what you are seeing first and foremost is a physical pattern in your brain, and its observed properties are the properties of the neural correlates viewed directly from the perspective of being a correlate ourself, we can see our own brain from the inside, but it looks like a world to us instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2012-06-16 16:04:22','2012-06-16 16:04:22'),(2046,96,48,'James: I wrote out yet another big reply, but instead I just want to clarify, how do you actually propose subjective experience arises from neural events?

You think the lack of a material existence deprives mathematical operations of the power to work together to form beliefs, certainty, knowledge, awareness, or experiences. Although you do not know precisely what gives chemicals this marvelous power that has been withheld from math, you know it must exist because you, as a wetware man, have subjective experiences, and the idea of using numbers to represent certainty in an abstract model is just not a satisfying substitute for having \'real awareness\'.

As that, alone, seems a bit difficult.  Such would be a huge help in our efforts, I believe.\r\n\r\nI\'m betting that whatever formulation of initial fundamental conditions we come up with to base such a proof on, James proof will require an initial assumption that the only tools we have to work with are discrete units of computational operation.  Examples being neuron or transistor like discrete elements that take inputs from causally upstream units, and send signals to more of the same causally downstream units.  These discrete units are capable of detecting signals from multiple upstream units, and based on easily mathematically describable operations, such as \"Boolean logic\", or mathematical integration or amplification... and then sending the results to more of the same kind of downstream discrete units.\r\n\r\nGiven that fundamental assumption, I would completely agree with James, that he could be successful at coming up with a proof I would accept.  But, doing so would only miss the important theoretical possibility I think is critically important - that there are more than such discrete computational units possible in known physical reality.\r\n\r\nIt isn\'t possible to resolve the \'binding problem\' of philosophy, given only discrete computational units.  It isn\'t possible to make a system that is aware of something that must have redness in the left hemisphere, unified with something in the right hemisphere with greenness, in a way that we are aware of all of it at the same time.  and in a way so that our knowledge of redness, and how it is different than the greenness, can be the initial cause of our picking the strawberry.  My argument is that there is some system in the brain that can accomplish this achievement, that must be more than such simple discrete units of computation.\r\n\r\nWhen examined, with mere abstracted knowledge of the brain, such will look like a system that detects glutamate, and only glutamate, or at least the causal properties of glutamate.  Nothing else but glutamate causing the system to make the claim that it is redness.\r\n\r\nBut, the prediction is that when we discover the phenomenal qualities of the same, this will provide additional insight into why the particular causal behaviors behave the way they do, in a way that appears to cause the glutamate to cause us to select the strawberry.  The base fundamental reason we pick the red one, will no longer be just the abstracted information about glutamate, we will know, additionally, the reason glutamate behaves the way it does, is because it also has these phenomenal qualities the system knows about.  Again, not adding any additional causal laws, just greater understanding and effing vision of all that is involved with such.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, my claim that glutamate has redness, is only an idealized theoretical possibility, not meant to be anything like reality, which I\'d bet is much more complex than this.  The hope with this idealized example is just to show one simplified theoretical possibility, to communicate the basic effing ideas I\'m trying to understand, and to provide at least one falsifying theoretical example to your claim of what you can prove.

As long as we don\'t mistake this analogical experience for the real world that it attempts to replicate in effigy, we can see that th properties of the world of experience are manifestly analogical and reified, like an actual painted 3-D model, as opposed to the abstracted logical deductions we make from our experience, which do indeed appear to occur in a discrete sequential fashion.\r\n\r\nThe principal difficulty most people have in understanding this argument, is that they mistake the analogical spatial component of conscious experience as the world itself, that it represents in effigy.

But this argument is invalid. For in fact there is no need for an internal observer of the scene, since the internal representation is simply a data structure like any other data in a computer, except that this data is expressed in spatial form. For if a picture in the head required a homunculus to view it, then the same argument would hold for any other form of information in the brain, which would also require a homunculus to read or interpret that information. In fact any information encoded in the brain needs only to be available to other internal processes rather than to a miniature copy of the whole brain. The fact that the brain does go to the trouble of constructing a full spatial analog of the external environment merely suggests that it has ways to make use of this spatial data. In other words, the brain employes an analogical paradigm of perceptual computation to make use of the analogical data in spatial perception.\r\n\r\nHere in Chapter 1 of my book\r\n\r\nhttp://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/book/chap1.html\r\n\r\n(under heading An Analogical Paradigm of Representation)\r\n\r\nThis raises the question of why the brain goes to the trouble of constructing an internal replica of the external world, and why that replica has to be presented as a vivid spatial structure instead of some kind of abstract symbolic code. It also raises the philosophical question of who is viewing that internal replica of the external world. For if the presence of an internal model of the world required a little man, or \"homunculus\" in your brain to observe it, that little man would itself have to have an even smaller man in its little head, resulting in an infinite regress of observers within observers. But the internal model of the external world is not constructed so as to be viewed by an internal observer, but rather, the internal model is a data structure in the brain, just like any data in a computer, with the sole exception that this data is expressed in explicit spatial form. If a picture in the head required a homunculus to view it, then the same argument would hold for any other form of information in the brain, which would also require a homunculus to read or interpret that information. In fact any internal representation need only be available to other internal processes rather than to a miniature copy of the whole brain. The reason why the brain expresses perceptual experience in explicit spatial form must be because the brain possesses spatial computational algorithms capable of processing that spatial information. In fact the nature of those spatial algorithms is itself open to phenomenological examination, as I will show shortly. \r\n\r\nOn p. 38 of the same book I cite Steven Pinker making the same argument\r\n\r\nPinker (1984, p. 38) pointed out, however, that there is no need for an internal observer of the scene, because the internal representation is merely a data structure like any other data in a computer, except that these data are expressed in spatial form. In fact any information in the brain needs only to be available to other internal processes, rather than to a miniature copy of the whole brain. To deny the spatial nature of the perceptual representation in the brain is to deny the spatial nature so clearly evident in the world we perceive around us.\r\n\r\nIn my Gestalt Isomorphism paper:\r\n\r\nhttp://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html\r\n\r\n6.1 The Cartesian Theatre and the Homunculus Problem\r\n\r\nThis \"picture-in-the-head\" or \"Cartesian theatre\" concept of visual representation has been criticized on the grounds that there would have to be a miniature observer to view this miniature internal scene, resulting in an infinite regress of observers within observers (Dennett 1991, 1992, O\'Regan 1992, Pessoa et al. 1998). In fact there is no need for an internal observer of the scene, since the internal representation is simply a data structure like any other data in a computer, except that this data is expressed in spatial form (Earle 1998, Singh & Hoffman 1998, Lehar 2003). For if a picture in the head required a homunculus to view it, then the same argument would hold for any other form of information in the brain, which would also require a homunculus to read or interpret that information. In fact any information encoded in the brain needs only to be available to other internal processes rather than to a miniature copy of the whole brain. The fact that the brain does go to the trouble of constructing a full spatial analog of the external environment merely suggests that it has ways to make use of this spatial data. For example field theories of navigation have been proposed (Koffka 1935 pp 42-46, Gibson & Crooks, 1938) in which perceived objects in the perceived environment exert spatial field-like forces of attraction and repulsion, drawing the body towards attractive percepts, and repelling it from aversive percepts, as a spatial computation taking place in a spatial medium. If the idea of an explicit spatial representation in the brain seems to \"fly in the face of what we know about the neural substrates of space perception\" (Pessoa et al. 1998 author\'s response R3.2 p. 789), it is our theories of spatial representation that are in urgent need of revision. For to deny the spatial nature of the perceptual representation in the brain is to deny the spatial nature so clearly evident in the world we perceive around us. To paraphrase Descartes, it is not only the existence of myself that is verified by the fact that I think, but when I experience the vivid spatial presence of objects in the phenomenal world, those objects are certain to exist, at least in the form of a subjective experience, with properties as I experience them to have, i.e. location, spatial extension, color, and shape. I think them, therefore they exist (Price 1932, p. 3). All that remains uncertain is whether those percepts exist also as objective external objects as well as internal perceptual ones, and whether their perceived properties correspond to objective properties. But their existence and fully spatial nature in my internal perceptual world is beyond question if I experience them so, even if only as a hallucination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat tired old argument keeps coming back like a bad penny, even though its been refuted again and again. Because even people who hear the refutation refuse to acknowledge it as a counter-argument, because no mere logical argument is sufficient to shake them free of their comfortable naive realism!\r\n','2012-06-18 15:19:23','2012-06-18 15:19:23'),(2067,116,44,'Continuing to Mike Gashler:\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and here it is in the Cartoon Epistemology:\r\n\r\nhttp://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/cartoonepist/cartoonepist42.html\r\n\r\nBut who is the viewer of this internal theatre of the mind?

Before the rest of you get too far down the wrong path, let me explain. The universe consists of states of matter, s. Let the state of matter at time t be, s_t. The universe has a transition function f. Right? With me so far? Ok, the transition function, f, is either deterministic (if you believe in the MWI of QM), or else it is completely random with absolutely no pattern or intentionality (if you believe in the copenhagen interpretation of QM). Thus, in the deterministic case: So s_{t+1})=f(s_t); and in the non-deterministic case: So p(s_{t+1})=f(s_t).  Ok, still with me?\r\n\r\nNOW, let\'s posit something \"else\", anything \"else\". We will call it e, for \"else\" and \"experience\". Now, write down the function for the state transitions such that the else affects the state transitions, but can\'t be written as part of the state. What you immediately notice is that there is no way to do this. It can\'t be done. If you try (and I have tried), you end up creating a system that can always be re-written with a \"super\" state, that contains the old state and e, with a new transition function. \r\n\r\nIf you try and write it as a Bayesian network, you can try and write e in a manner similar to that of a hidden markov model, with e \"hidden\" from outside observers, but visible from the first person perspective only. But if you do that, then you have created something that is observable ONLY from the first person perspective, but that affects (and is affected by) the third person perspective. The problem here, is that we are pretty darn sure that the third person perspective is enought to account for all the causal behavior. Which means that we can observe all the objective state necessary to constrain the probability of the next state of the system. So if there is anything \"more\" going on here, that \"more\" doesn\'t constrain the next state of the system... that makes it epiphenomenal. I really don\'t understand why this rather obvious observation is so hard for people to grasp. \r\n\r\nFor example, Brent writes: \"But, doing so would only miss the important theoretical possibility I think is critically important - that there are more than such discrete computational units possible in known physical reality...My argument is that there is some system in the brain that can accomplish this achievement, that must be more than such simple discrete units of computation.\"  But this misses the point that these \"discrete computational units\" ARE sufficient to characterize the behavior of the system, and even to characterize and track the third person objective states of the matter making up the system! So what does that mean? It means, yet again, that if there actually is anything \"more\" than these computational units, then they don\'t affect the third person objective reality in any way, and thus are epiphenominal!!!!! I don\'t know why that remarkably obvious observation is so hard to understand, and I must admit to a certain bit of frustration in my attempts.\r\n\r\n\"But, the prediction is that when we discover the phenomenal qualities of the same, this will provide additional insight into why the particular causal behaviors behave the way they do, in a way that appears to cause the glutamate to cause us to select the strawberry.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, Brent is proposing that e affects s through t... something like s_{t+1}=f(e_t,s_t) and e_{t+1}=f(e_t,s_t). Further, he is suggesting that, to date, we have been ignoring e, and mistakenly proposing s_{t+1}=f(s_t)... and that once we add this extra ingredient, we will suddenly realize how much simpler the equation with the \'e\' in it is, and we will better understand WHY things have the causal properties that they do. I WISH Brent would be formal about this, so I wouldn\'t have to guess what he is thinking from his ambiguous text, but this is at least what I THINK he is saying. In any event, this is essentually proposing that e is a hidden node in a network, at least hidden from the third person perspective. But this makes predictions about how the states of matter should behave. Information (that effects the next state) has to be pushed into e, and then flow out of e to affect the next s. If this were not the case, we could leave it out, and ignore it when computing the state transitions (meaning it would be epiphenomenal). To see why this flow of information is needed, just consider that the objective effects of the perception process needs to inform our experience of the strawberry (so information MUST flow INTO e form the previous states). Then note that for the experience to affect the future objective state (to avoid epiphenomenalism), this information must now be allowed to flow OUT of e, and back into s. There are two ways that this could happen... 1. in a straightforward deterministic way (where no \"processing\" happens hidden back in e), and 2 in a more complex way. \r\n\r\nIn the case of 1, we see that we can always simplify the equation by taking e out, and we get the same objective result. Therefore there is no reason to believe in e, not even our \"feelings\" of qualia, since we can account for all the motion of the atoms in our brains without it, and thus account for our claims, beliefs, and memories of qualia without it. If taking e out does impact the objective state, such that you can\'t predict the next state accurately without taking it into account, then we actually have case 2. \r\n\r\nIn case 2, we find that this theory has a very powerful objective prediction which is not met in our observations. We should SEE information appear to \"vanish\" form the objective third person reality, only to then impact future objective states in strange ways. Yet this prediction has not been observed in reality. That\'s not how matter and energy behaves. Instead, the third person state is enough to predict the probability of the future state, and Bells equation even tells us that there is no extra hidden state that accounts for the randomness of the Copenhagen interpretation of QM.  \r\n\r\nSo, it would seem that Brent\'s theory (if I understand it correctly) has already been falsified. If I don\'t understand it correctly, then by all means, explain it formally in stead of handwavey so that I can understand it better.

The obvious problems with such systems is everyone doesn\'t have time to read a million individual posts, to find out what a million people believe.\r\n\r\nCanonizer.com is meant to overcome this problem, but in order to do so, the contributors need to work to push to switch from this traditional kind of thinking and individual posting.\r\n\r\nThis is all just my opinion, so take it only as such, and I recognize that you may disagree, so if you do, that is great.  Just take it as only my opinion.\r\n\r\nFor example, it seems to me much of the stuff in this Self-centred VR is duplicated from the Representational Qualia Statement.

It demonstrates that a representation in a vacuum is insufficient to explain consciousness by asking the question, \'who experiences the representation?\'. This question implies that creating a representation makes no progress toward experiencing anything. We respond that it does make progress, which we now identify: The value of a representation is that the representation exists in the same information or thought form that the brain is able to interact with. (The brain cannot very well reach out and interact with the world, but it can easily operate on its own representation of the world.) Although we admit that creating a representation alone is insufficient to explain consciousness, we claim that creating a representation alone is sufficient to explain awareness, and we define consciousness as awareness coupled with the ability to act on it. Hence, representationalism explains the part of consciousness that is otherwise difficult to explain. The rest can be explained with a simple decision-making technique. To experience something is to be aware of it, and to be able to act on it. To the question raised by the homunculus argument, \'who experiences the representation?\', we answer that the same brain which creates the representation is able to act on it, and thus it meets the two components that define an experience.','2012-06-25 10:16:00','2012-06-25 10:16:00'),(2115,96,48,'Reply to Mike Gashler:\r\n\r\nRepresentationalism, while necessary to explain how we experience external entities, is not sufficient as an explanation of the mystery of consciousness, or how we can be conscious of anything.\r\n\r\nThe alternative, naive realism, does NOT resolve that mystery either, in fact it DEEPENS the mystery to give us direct conscious experience of objects outside of our head, beyond the sensory surface, which is DOUBLY magical and inexplicable, and STILL does not answer the question of how we can be conscious of anything.\r\n\r\nThe homunculus objection is invalid, because a representation does not require a complete copy of the brain to observe the representation, as we can see so clearly demonstrated in a digital computer, that can read the data of its internal images without use of a homunculus.\r\n\r\nThe response of the naive realists is to insist that there are no images in computers, because if there were, then that would show the homunculus argument is invalid, and would provide a concrete demonstration of the principle of representationalism, and that it actually works and can be built in real hardware, and that in turn is so damaging to the cause of naive realism that they have to DENY THE OBVIOUS and insist that an image is not an image UNLESS THERE IS A HOMUNCULUS TO OBSERVE IT, and since the homunculus is impossible, thus there are no images in the brain!\r\n\r\nIt is just plain MADNESS!

Having a hallucination doesn\'t mean that there is some universe where the pink elephant is real, only that in this universe what you are can really hallucinate. In a way, it is the hallucination that exposes the reality of perception, not the unreality of subjectivity. Our waking life is the hallucination, drugs only expose the fact to us. At the same time, our subjective experience may seem private and ephemeral to us, but that too is a hallucination. We have no reason to assume that the universe has that same bias.\r\n\r\n> \"I BEGIN with the assumption that there is an image on the retina, which is sent up the optic nerve to the brain\"\r\n\r\nI assume that you know about studies where subjects wear glasses that invert the retina image? Eventually they begin to see it as right side up. Looking at ambiguous \'images\', like this: http://multisenserealism.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/aslide7.jpg we see that we can have a degree of voluntary control of our visual interpretation. We are not passive recipients of externally stable optical phenomena, we shape the optical phenomena into images. Who we are and what we have experienced influences the qualities and significance of the visual experience. It is not \'out there\' - not on pixels, not on paper, retina cells, or the visual cortex. No more than comedy or irony is encoded in the bits of an mpeg file. That is not to say that optical arrangements are not the vehicle or stage upon which visual images are projected - of course they are, but there is an ontological chasm separating them. These small images you are reading now do not exist if your eyes do not belong to someone who can read English. That is what I mean when I say there are not objectively images in cameras or retina. There are qualitative changes to substances which we interpret as images, nothing more.\r\n\r\n>\"Sorry, can\'t help you!\"\r\n\r\nOh I know, but it\'s ok I don\'t need any help.

If the brain can learn its own vocabulary of billions of synaptic phonemes, why not just learn the vocabulary of photons directly as the retina does? Representation without presentation is a figment of our over-familiarity with symbols. We think that because computer data looks like a video game to us that the video game is made of computer data. It isn\'t. The computer no more knows what a basketball player looks like than I know how to read Chinese.\r\n\r\nI understand why representationalism seems to make so much sense, and I agree that it is almost exactly right, but once you can stop taking pattern recognition *ALL pattern recognition* for granted, then you will see why representation does nothing except move the hard problem from outside the body to inside the brain. There is still no plausible explanation for any experience to appear in connection to the brain if the brain already has all of the information that it is representing as that experience. Totally redundant and superfluous. Totally unexplainable as an evolutionary adaptation. It only makes sense the other way around.

If we ever get some substance dualists, we\'ll probably have to push property dualism down a level to make room for them in the \'dualism of all types\' camp.  But for now it is unanimously property dualists, and the clear expert consensus even amongst these is for mind brain identity.\r\n\r\nLet me ask you what you mean, when you say there is no conscious experience in a computer.  Because that difference (i.e. there are two types of things, things that can be simulated in a computer, and things that cannot.) which is the only \'dualist\' thing the supporters of property dualism are talking about.  It is just qualities of things, or different ways to look at the same stuff.\r\n\r\nWhen you are the only one that can\'t see what all these experts see, when they claim to be both \"mind brain identity\" and \"property dualists\", this is strong evidence that you are missing something.

The word qualia exists to make that explicit. Whether they can be tied to physics directly or not, they are not in directly recognizable as what we think of as physics.\r\n\r\nEven if qualia, or anything else for that matter, was epiphenomenal, how does physics allow for that either?

You could not just \'feel happy\' because that would invoke a forbidden layer of qualia in between neurochemistry and the contents of our experience.\r\n\r\nMy idea is this. Physics is the inside of Plato\'s Cave. When we leave the cave we have access to our full complement of human sensitivities and motives, well beyond the range of those which can be detected and understood using inanimate objects as instruments. What you and Dennett are doing is pointing to the fact that since we see shadows both inside and outside the cave, that all of the bright color and crisp 3-D images we \'seem\' to see \'outside\' are merely epiphenomena and the only true reality is in the interplay of shadows. Mathematical forms rendered to us without bias or sentiment.\r\n\r\nThis would be making a case for naive realism though - which I don\'t. It turns out that the shadows seem to make a sense of their own, which extend our understanding far beyond the colors outside. The cave is good and real too, just in a very different way. In fact, the shadows tell us everything about what we *are not* and what we think is the inside of the cave is really just another kind of outside, and the outside is really just another kind of cave. Both caves are inside and outside of each other, and everything in the entire universe is made of this caving-uncaving anomalous symmetry (anomalous since the inside is \'vertical\': infinitely personal, temporal, and signifying while the outside is \'horizontal\': infinitely impersonal, spatial, and generic.)','2012-07-05 21:09:12','2012-07-05 21:09:12'),(2173,96,48,'\"How is SEEMing possible in physics alone?

Why use a palette at all - just have your retina \'be\' your visual cortex and use the light itself as your palette. We can talk ourselves into ideas of representation if we smuggle consciousness in using a retrospective view but none of it makes any sense from a prospective view of consciousness.

There is no port which translates qualia into any material property at all. No Cartesian theater or homunculus, so that any phenomenal property that can be experienced must be generated as it is inside the tissue of the brain. You are saying that the memory of the smell of fried chicken actually smells like fried chicken inside of the cells of your brain. It doesn\'t. Without doing brain surgery first hand I can tell you that nothing in the brain smells very delicious. I suggest that you try completely banishing all traces of visual or auditory qualia in your thinking for a few minutes. Consider that Helen Keller lived a human life and learned to communicate without seeing or hearing. How does that fit into MMPD? Do the memories of her teacher touching her hand or whatever exist in glutamate? It\'s just a non-starter, and going back to billiard ball anything is, not to sound surly, a joke. Behaviorism and 19th century materialism are dead. We tried that already.

It is tricky to avoid doing this, I think partly because we are now used to computers having a GUI that displays a spatial field of digital bits so that we don\'t realize that this display exists for a human user and has no conceivable use within a computation device that already has all of the information that it would display to itself.\r\n\r\n\"the physical body (which we do not experience) and the neurological body-image (which we do).\"\r\n\r\nYes, although I would say that we have an indirect experience of the body as a collection of material forms and a direct experience of the body as a history of sense-motive participation. My conjecture here is that these categories of experience are a dual aspect ontology, both being equally \'physical\' but the former has a physicality which is fragmented across space and the latter has a physicality which is condensed through time. This is a new way of looking at physics but I think that it will prove to be essential for understanding consciousness.\r\n\r\n\"2. Adherence to the incoherent theory of mind-brain identity. This theory fails to conform to Leibnizâ€™s Law of the Identity of Indiscernibles.\"\r\n\r\nRight. I think this problem goes away when we understand the nature of the dual aspect ontology - the what+how aspect and the who+why aspect which intersect as a place+time localization-synchronization. This is what brain activity and mind activity have in common - the place of the former can be positively correlated with the time of the latter. The further we get from that intersection in the moment, the less possible it is to relate the two aspects directly. Think of two perpendicular Turing machines, one that is a literal machine cranking out a tape of binary numbers, and one a figurative tape cranking out numbered Turing machines. There is an anomalous symmetry which requires one to know not just physiology and function but the cumulative sense and motives of any particular individual and the world they come out of.\r\n\r\n\" 3. The muddle over the â€˜ homunculusâ€™ (a.k.a â€˜the little green man in the headâ€™). This is based on the confusion between sensing and perceiving. Just because we need an image to perceive a physical object, this does not entail that we need an image to have (examine) a sensation.\"\r\n\r\nI don\'t so much see an important distinction between sensing and perceiving. They are vague colloquial terms which probably don\'t help us discern what they are supposed to stand for. As for the homunculus, I don\'t think it\'s confused, I think it makes the point that having a model of any kind in the brain would not resolve any of the problems of mind vs matter. Saying that the brain makes a model of matter and the mind reads the model doesn\'t explain, if the brain can access matter and be accessed by the mind, why would any \'model\' be necessary and how does it exist as a formless entity that mediates two opposite experiences of form (world experienced directly and brain experienced indirectly in the world).\r\n\r\n\" 4. The muddle over â€˜qualiaâ€™. â€˜Qualiaâ€™ is a misleading term invented by philosophers to describe what IT IS LIKE to have a sensation. What we should be discussing is WHAT IT IS to have a sensation: vide Adrian 1928. \"\r\n\r\nI feel that qualia is misleading because it deals only with the presentation layer of our naive realism without allowing us to rationalize it in any way. I think that what it is to have a sensation is both a \'what it is like\' and \'what it is\' and that in fact this is the same dual aspect as direct (seems like) and indirect (seems like it is ) experience of physical realism. With this diagram http://multisenserealism.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/aslide13.jpg I suggest a relationship between layer or caste proximity to the subject and the strength of the \'seems like\' vs \'simply is\' perceptual bias.\r\n\r\n\"5. The almost universal assumption that Cartesian Dualism is the only form of dualism there is: whereas in fact other forms of material dualism based in ideas in modern physics (e.g. hyperspace) are being developed.\"\r\n\r\nSure, yeah. I see many dualisms, dialectics, trinities, quadruplicities etc. All of them are under the aegis of what I call, for the lack of a better term, sense. Symmetry is a key part of sense...foreground, background, stop/go, literal/figurative, etc. Mind-matter is just the tip of the iceberg, and a very anthropomorphic tip at that.\r\n\r\n\" 6.

The more \'dilated\' your perceptual bias can be toward the \'seems like\' the more your perception of time is fluid and seen as a returning cycle within eternity and the less you experience the \'simply is\' definition of discrete instants of linear duration - an arithmetic emptiness of dimension x+1 within which physical events are contained.\r\n\r\n\"7.

In one interpretation, it got posted seven times because I was unfamiliar with the posting system, and repeated it when it did not seem to be sending anything. On another interpretation my computer was responding to the archetype of Seven Pillars of Wisdom!\r\nTo take up some of your points:\r\n1. re the body-image. The neurological point is that the experience of a body part continues even if the body part is amputated. The phenomenon of the phantom limb is of course widely known. What may not be widely known is that a phantom limb can often be moved both voluntarily as well as automaticallyâ€”as when a patient\'s phantom limb extends to \'catch\' a ball thrown at her. Furthermore, in many cases of arm amputation, if the patient is touched on the face, she will feel the touch on her fingers. In these cases the face touch system has taken over the now inactive finger touch neurons.\r\nI would say that we have no phenomenal experience of the body, but that we experience the body image (phenomenal body) linked to its NCCs in the brain (shades of Ludwigâ€”Jonathan Harrison\'s infamous brain-in-a-vat).\r\n2. You say \" This is what brain activity and mind activity have in common - the place of the former can be positively correlated with the time of the latter.\" Undoubtedlyâ€”but I think that we can go further. I suggest that he mind has its own \'place\' (its visual and somatic sensations, as we experience them, are extended in phenomenal space (think also of the space of a dream). Phenomenal space has its own geometry and topology (vide Robert French\'s work), and can thus be related to physical space. Either one\'s own phenomenal space is that small part of physical space in which one\'s  brain is extended: or it lies outside the brain in a space of its own. Here is where the hyper dimensional theories come in.\r\n3. I am using \'sensing\' and \'perceiving\' in the technical sense introduced by C. D. Broad and H. H. Price. We can be said to perceive physical objects using the entire physiological chain of perception. We sense only its end productsâ€”as when we examine an after-image and observe what color it is.\r\n6. I agree that the passage of time is a very complex subject. But that does not account for the embarrassing fact that contemporary physics, which claims to be the Theory of Everything, can account neither for the \'now\' nor the passage of time.\r\n7. You say \"Yes, an excellent point that really throws a wrench into any possible information-theoretic-functionalist scheme to explain consciousness.\" \r\nAbsolutely! Some of the details get even more interesting. \r\nHere\'s one: If you look with both eyes open at a light flickering at 6-18 Hz you will experience (\'sense\') simple geometric hallucinations in your visual field (parallel lines, checkerboards, grids, mazes, families of circles, etc. in several colors). These are produced by interactions between the brain\'s own electrical rhythms and the electrical rhythms induced by the flickering stimulus. However, if only one eye is stimulated, something quite different happens. You see at first the geometrical patterns but these soon get replaced by quite a different phenomenon. These are patterns constructed of continuous oily swirls, like oil on water or boiling mud, in two colors, usually red and green. These two (geometrical flickering patters and continuous oily swirls) then proceed to alternate in retinal rivalry. This indicates that the oily swirls are arising in the inactive cortical neurons connected only to the closed eye. If we examine the neuroanatomy involved, we find that the two are connected by a continuous syncytium of GABAergic inhibitory neurons that use both chemical and electrical junctions: and it is the continuous swirling activity of direct currents in these inhibitory neurons (or the interaction of this electrical activity with the attached pyramidal visual neurons) that \'appears\' as the oily swirls in consciousness. (In this regards contemporary neuroscience thinks almost entirely in terms of binary action potentials (spikes), rather that direct currents). I think that this is the first demonstration of a detailed link between a specific sensation and a specific brain activity. So how can a swirling mass of electrons in a neural syncytium be identical with an oily swirl of green and red colors???','2012-07-07 21:57:44','2012-07-07 21:57:44'),(2227,96,48,'John,\r\n\r\nOutstanding perceptual info. About perceptual illusions, my view takes into account the following:\r\n\r\n1. Although I maintain that the underlying reality is not computation, using a computation model is useful because:\r\n\r\na. we are dealing with an event which directly exposes sub-self level experiences to the top level self.\r\n\r\nb. quanta is the flattest qualia; the inter-qualitative protocols governing how experiences are divided up publicly and privately.\r\n\r\nc. this means that in cases where the whole-self systems are broken or fooled, we are automatically looking more at the objective side of things than the balanced view. If you cut a book in half, you learn more about paper than you do about writing.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to get at is that who we are is a physical reality through time rather than space, and it is defined more by the totality of our life experience when we are healthy and whole than when our life is impacted by a medical event. The more impacted we are by illness or dysfunction, the more we are reduced to a collection of objective systems. When our top level awareness is pushed beyond its specifications, as in an optical illusion, we learn a lot about perception, but mainly the physiological end of it. It is our access to sense which is being interrupted, not the production of sense. To learn about the meaningful end of perception, we should turn to cross-cultural and etymological patterns in language and first hand accounts.\r\n\r\nFor things like optical illusions and phantom limbs, I to try to understand them not only in terms of a failure of our private realism to map accurately to public realism - which is the obvious but deceptive reading, but as the success of our perceptual inertial frame to maintain its narratives (perceptual momentum). \r\n\r\nOne way of thinking about the amputation is that the outermost sense of the body is compromised, so that the well developed awareness associated with the limb shares the bandwidth of the equally well developed awareness associated with the face. There a law of conservation of qualitative significance. \r\n\r\nThis sharing of multiple private forms (figurative fingers and face) with a single public form (literal face) goes against a representation model in that we would not expect the model to effortlessly convert itself to represent a completely different part of the body by default. To the contrary, RQT implies an epiphenomenal modeling of hard sense data. What we see instead is that the publicly real face is actually better understood as the software and the privately real fingers are more like the hardware. Naturally we could see it the opposite way, and that again is the obvious, but I think ultimately inverted characterization of what has happened. \r\n\r\nTo understand consciousness, we have to stop looking at the brain as a device that produces consciousness and look instead at the totality of a human lifetime in the context of the history of the universe as the relevant physical system. The brain is nothing but a complex cursor into the GUI of physical realism. It is the physical realism that is lowest common denominator shadows of concrete awareness, which is what the universe can only be \'made of.\'\r\n\r\n\"think that we can go further. I suggest that he mind has its own \'place\' (its visual and somatic sensations, as we experience them, are extended in phenomenal space (think also of the space of a dream). Phenomenal space has its own geometry and topology (vide Robert French\'s work), and can thus be related to physical space.\"\r\n\r\nThis gets tricky too. In general it is shocking enough to say that the self is a phenomenology through private time and its shadow is the the phenomenology across public space. That is the basic truth. The more advanced considerations are that public space is really space-time and private time is really time-space. The difference is this: You have an experience of phenomenal space in dreams or the mind but they have no object constancy. You can\'t come back to a dream and reliably find your glasses where you left them. You might find a pterodactyl there instead. What I suggest is that space is a subtly different presentation than place. We have no phenomenal space qua space, only a buffer of temporarily persistent placement. This is similar to our phenomenal experience of time, which is not really time qua time, but narrative continuity of experience. Phenomenal space and time is really more like scene and plot. To get at objective public realism, you need generic multiplicity - gears and teeth behind the presentation which reliably synchronize agreement among inter-qualitative phenomena among the various participants and layers/frames/scales of participation.\r\n\r\n\"I agree that the passage of time is a very complex subject. But that does not account for the embarrassing fact that contemporary physics, which claims to be the Theory of Everything, can account neither for the \'now\' nor the passage of time. \"\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. I first came across what you are talking about after doing this crazy mural relating the continuum of public and private realism (...stationlink.com/art/comp7.jpg) and reading into it deeply. On the left side there is a suggestion of a large lower case \"i\" (which contrasts to a large, wild i that fractures the picture plane on the right). I apologize for most people reading this who will not know what I am talking about - but anyways, the thing is that it gave me an understanding of the failure of physics to ground the sense of I into a here and now. You have relativity with its inertial frames, but no theory of anything to initiate perception in the first place. The \"i\" appears as a an arbitrarily inverted transparent window into nothing special. A random collection of evolved mechanisms of self reference. This is a problem. It is the equal and opposite problem that ideal monism/naive realism has where the \"i\" cannot be reigned in to a persistent sensible context. Physics has the context, but no text and no reader. It is all flat black and white flat quanta trying to explain away full spectrum color qualia.\r\n\r\n\"So how can a swirling mass of electrons in a neural syncytium be identical with an oily swirl of green and red colors???\"\r\n\r\nRight. Only if the colors and the electrons are opposite presentations (one public quanta and the other private qualia) of a common neutral monism - which I call sense. What we see as the colors is the agreement between the part of us we identify with normally as the observer and the part of us whose experience we feel visually as color. All that we see is the embodied change in ourselves which is the local filtration of the global change events in which we participate. We are seeing part of ourselves change. \"We\" are the body, the brain, the neurons, the molecules, the electrons. We are the culture, the species, the biosphere, the planet, the solar system, etc. Not literally as objects - that is the opposite presentation of disunity - but figuratively as subjects through time.\r\n\r\nI\'m not trying to be mystical about this at all, I think that is is the only legitimate scientific approach to understanding consciousness completely. Other models will take us far, but only the one which fully integrates phenomenological awareness into the universe as a whole will ultimately satisfy us.','2012-07-08 01:33:58','2012-07-08 01:33:58'),(2230,96,48,'Multisense Realism writes:\r\n\r\n>>>>\r\n\r\nThe reason that a robotic brain can\'t see anything is because it isn\'t made of anything that has evolved by itself to see.\r\n\r\n<<<<\r\n\r\nAnd the reason why machines can\'t fly is because they have not evolved to fly.

Is that so hard to swallow? About as hard as a ten pound pineapple!\"\r\n\r\nBy that logic we should be able to teach a slug to play the violin. There has never been a byte of information that has given the slightest indication that it feels something. Feeling cannot arise from a collection of inanimate objects - unless they aren\'t really inanimate.\r\n\r\n\"you propose that there is something magical and mystical in living systems that cannot be reduced to mere\"\r\n\r\nI have never proposed anything more or less than the ordinary feeling and living that we undeniably experience ourselves. No magic. You are confusing my argument with some straw man in your mind.\r\n\r\n\"there is something magical in vision that allows only animals to see, not inanimate machines\"\r\n\r\nWhat we mean by \'seeing\' would certainly be magical for a non-animal to experience. Detecting optical conditions like a CDC cell is not the same thing as seeing full color panoramic scenes that make narrative sense. I can make a pinhole camera by poking a hole in a cardboard box. Are you suggesting that the hole sees? Does the emulsion coated celluloid see?\r\n\r\n\"if a sea scallop http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scallop can see with its primitive eyes sufficient to slam the shell closed to a looming movement, then an automatic door-opener can \"see\" too, at least in a primitive way.\"\r\n\r\nI find it hard to believe that this argument sounds reasonable to anyone, so I don\'t know that anything I can say will rouse you out of your naive materialism here, but let me see - if a corpse falls off of a slab in the morgue, does that mean they have reanimated themselves? If a bowling ball falls on my foot does that mean it is a predator of human beings? Symbol Grounding Problem. There is no way I can make you understand it, you have to be able to doubt your own certainty first.\r\n\r\n\"are inescapable clues to the mechanism of vision\"\r\nThey are clues to the mechanism of optics. They have nothing whatsoever with any kind of visual experience. To the contrary, a data pipeline has no sensory preference at all - not only could it just as easily be aural or olfactory qualia which was produced by a camera, but it would be much more likely to not require any sensory forms at all. Until you can tell me why a camera is more likely to produce a seeable image than a smellable image there is really nothing to talk about - your accusations and hand-waving are just your own sentiment and irritation with me personally. Your insistence on mechanistic visual qualia has no explanatory power.\r\n\r\n\"only an anti-scientific dogmatist would deny that this is a\r\nprimitive form of vision, that the automaton can \"see\" even if only\r\ndimly and stupidly.\"\r\n\r\nThat isn\'t true though. It\'s nothing but an ad hominem argument from authority. Two, two, two fallacies in one. Of course the automaton doesn\'t see. Pinhole camera. What sees? Us. We see. The film itself sees no images. It\'s not anti-scientific at all. In fact mine is a significantly more nuanced, more scientific approach. I understand the distinction between form and being informed, between mechanistic detection-response, sentient sensation-appreciation, and the continuum of qualitative possibilities in between. There is no point in discussing these issues with you if you refuse to acknowledge them and keep pointing in the direction of naive mechanism. I\'ve been there before and I know why it doesn\'t work.\r\n\r\n\"We are on a totally different quest than you are.\"\r\nYes. You are on the alchemists quest of trying to turn lead into gold. I am pointing out that it doesn\'t work that way.\r\n\r\n\"You are wasting everybody\'s time with your vitalistic nonsense and re-definition of well accepted meaning of common terms like \"image\" to mean something completely different than what everybody already understands\"\r\n\r\nReally? I am really wasting your time. How much time does it take to notice that I have posted something and to ignore it? Less than a second I would think. If you choose to engage with me than you are wasting your own time. It\'s much more of a waste of everyone\'s time to have to wade through this ad hominem garbage to get to the part where you address my (and now John Locke\'s as well) criticisms of neuro-mechanistic dogma. As for \"image\", why don\'t you describe to me precisely what neurology or physics has to say about an \"image\". What magical ingredient turns a non-image into an image? What did images evolve from? How did they aquire \'meaning\' and what is meaning. Why don\'t computers need to have images in their programming? To me, you have not even begun to formulate a definition of image, yet you accuse me of tainting it with an actual understanding. Not so scientific.\r\n\r\n\"Why don\'t you go to the Vitalist Dogmatist\'s convention with other naive realists who lack images on their retinas, and leave us alone to discuss science in peace amongst those who believe in it.\"\r\n\r\nHaha. You are really personally threatened by my ideas. Science is nothing without curiosity. Well, it isn\'t nothing, I suppose it is a blunt instrument for dominating others with your intellect too.\r\n\r\n\"It is not you personally that I am targeting, but that whole nonsense that comes around again and again wherever consciousness is discussed\"\r\n\r\nIf you don\'t intend to target me personally then telling me to go away and stop wasting everyone\'s time would not really be the way to express that. The reason that this whole nonsense \'comes around again and again\' is because your view fails to address the reality of consciousness. It will always keep coming around because naive mechanism can never work to explain even the most primitive forms of awareness (especially the most primitive forms...complex awareness is easier to get lost in and fool ourselves with AI puppetry).\r\n\r\n\"It\'s no use though. I don\'t think there is any hope that you will\r\nunderstand what I am saying\"\r\n\r\nI understand every word and syllable of what you are saying.\r\n\r\n\"that waste everybody\'s time over issues that are ALREADY LONG SETTLED among\r\nreasonable people!\"\r\n\r\nI must have missed the part where any issue about consciousness has been settled.

Despite this rapid achievement of some significant consensus for this new camp, it still lags behind the leading expert consensus [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/19 Property Dualism] camp at that level.\r\n\r\nIn response to the theoretically revolutionary success of this new emerging camp, the experts supporting the currently leading â€œclassic qualiaâ€ camp are working to canonize a new version of their camp statement containing a significant attack against this upstart.  This attack is against the â€˜mistakeâ€™ most often attributed to Daniel Dennett, when people claim we donâ€™t have qualia \"it just seems like we do.\" [Consciousness Explained P. 375].\r\n\r\nThe experts in this upstart camp, in response to this pending attack, have proposed that Daniel Dennett doesnâ€™t mean that we don\'t have some subjective experiences. It would be tautologically false to say, \"We don\'t have the experiences that we seem to have, we just seem to have them.\"  Instead, they suggest that Dennett is saying something like \"we don\'t have experiences that have any magical properties beyond the causal structure and dynamics of physics, it just seems like we do.\"\r\n\r\nIs this response being taken by this upstart camp the best consensus thinking by the most experts?  How many other experts are there that think this is a completely inadequate response, for the reasons being given in the newly proposed Property Dualism statement containing this attack?  Is this really a mistake?  Are there any other better ways to think about this issue out there, and how much consensus might there be for such?  Both camps would like to know, what Dr. Dennett thinks, so we can avoid this kind of speculation in any statements that end up making it through the canonization process.\r\n\r\nThis is an open letter in that we are seeking to survey for what everyone thinks on this issue.

If you say red, I know exactly what you mean. Voila - intersubjectivity. With my theory I mainly try to describe what consciousness actually is, and not try to shoehorn it into some made up category. Once we accept that all categories and notions of reality can only be knowable to us through consciousness, we are freed of the impossible task of converting consciousness into aggregates of unconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me again if you think we will be able to ever \'eff\' the ineffable,\r\nand how/why?\"\r\n\r\nEffing the ineffable is easy with sufficient technology. All you have to do is connect your brain to a device that can connect to other brains. Could be a transcranial magnetic appliance or a surgical implant. If you are talking about some kind of way of mathematically describing red that will enable blind people to see red just by understanding the description, then no, that is never going to happen.\r\n\r\n\"Could you, possibly, define what you mean by \'intersubjective\'\r\nhopefully in a way that is mechanically definitive enough so that one could simulate such in a computer, or artificial brain, or anything?\"\r\n\r\nNothing can simulate subjectivity, for the same reason that you cannot make a blind person see red by doing anything other than actually manipulating their brain to see red. It is not even clear that this is possible without a real experience of seeing red in the world - ie, you may have to cure their blindness in order for them to experience red in any way. That is something that could be experimentally shown one way or another. As far as I know there has never been a case of someone blind from birth who has gained sight later and verified that visual sense was in any way familiar to them. It may not be a potential of the brain alone, but an interaction of the brain, eye, and optical environment of the outside world.\r\n\r\nIntersubjective means that we share the same experiences. Whether they are exactly the same is not the point. Consciousness itself is made of \'seems like\'...jumping to conclusions, filling the gaps, etc, so just as heart cells synchronize their rhythm in close proximity, subjects can dance, communicate, co-operate, commune, etc and they do so routinely. Living organisms are social by definition - ie quorum sensing, plant communication, insect hives, etc. We share common sense and motives. This is not accomplished by any magical substance that flies through the air between us, rather it is that the separation between us is only real on some levels of description but not others. \r\n\r\nThe universe outside of our own consciousness can only be, on some level, one thing. A single moment. Consciousness is what divides that moment into smaller nested recapitulations of the whole. Physics-wise, there is really no support for any other possibility. Physics has no way of delineating any possible \"now\" or range of coherent temporal divisions. There are no beginnings and endings in physics, no place for an observer to arise from. Relativity works, once you assume an observer, but without that assumption, you are looking at one eternal indivisible moment.\r\n\r\nCraig','2012-07-09 02:20:31','2012-07-09 02:20:31'),(2263,96,48,'\r\nHi Craig,\r\n\r\nThere is lots of evidence here that you are still failing to understand much of the consensus theories  The worst problem is your ambiguous usage of the term \'red\'.

Nothing other than the quale of red is red in any way.

Not a solipsistic simulation, not naive realism, not naive materialism: multisense realism. Sense that is semi-permeable to objective realism. Red is not inside the brain, nor outside the brain. It has no location but our access to is governed through material relationships which do have locations. The brain is the vehicle through which red is experienced. Red is a visual feeling, which for us, is made of \'human lifetime\'. \r\n\r\nIt may seem strange and stupid to think of it this way, but instead of assuming that I am an idiot, just for fun consider that I might be years ahead of you.

Each module is busy processing its own input and providing an output, but how does one module know what another is doing, and how does the organism as a whole know what is going on, and what best to do next? Intercommunication between the modules soon leads to overload. Direct intermodular connections, however extensive, and non-linear dynamics can only go so far. \r\nFor example, in an army, one unit can make judgments about what to do next by observing what other units beside it in the line are doing, and making rational decisions. These may be right in the local context, but wrong in the context of the overall war plan. In the Napoleonic wars this is what generals in charge of brigades had to do during the time it took a galloping horse to get from Paris to Madrid. Another example is the battle of New Orleans, which was fought after the War of 1812 had ended. The advent of wireless telegraphy changed the situation. During WW2 Churchill set up a control room in the basement of 10 Downing Street. This was equipped with a large map in the center of the room, where small models of the planes, ships, tanks, etc. involved could be moved about in response to telegraphed reports from the front. The generals could review the whole situation at a glance, and make instant decisions about what orders to send back. We suggest that the claustrum, with its own internal maps, is doing the same thing. It not only â€˜bindsâ€™ sensory information, as Crick and Koch proposed, but it is receives edited incoming information (evaluated for novelty and salience) from five different channels (via thalamoclaustral afferents). It then calls in further reports and analyses, when needed, from areas of cortex it activates (by means of a web of synchronized oscillations and axon bursts). Lastly the claustrum circuits integrate all this activity (via intraclaustral synchronized oscillations), to come up with a series of executive orders transmitted to the motor cortex. In other words, the claustrum may do for its brain what Churchillâ€™s War Room did for the Allied armies. We do not imply that this model requires the infamous little green man in the War Room reading all this incoming data and making decisions based on it. The evaluation of the data and the decisions are both  functions of the interacting rhythms.\r\n\r\nHere is the last paragraph that provides a poetic finale: \r\n\r\nIn a study of sparse and dense codes in the brain during exposure to language passages and music Lloyd (2011) found that the resulting fMRI activity has properties more similar to music than to language. Crick and Koch (2005) famously likened the claustrum to the conductor of the orchestra. We agree that the evidence points to this role for the claustrum, as the conductor of an orchestra that plays a symphony woven out of a continual shimmering interplay of information-laden harmonies built out of synchronized potentials oscillating at many different frequencies.\r\n\r\n','2012-07-09 05:48:27','2012-07-09 05:48:27'),(2272,96,48,'Multisense Realism writes:\r\n\r\n>>>>\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange and stupid to think of it this way, but instead of assuming that I am an idiot, just for fun consider that I might be years ahead of you.

I agree with what you are saying about the need for intelligence to have a claustrum-like architecture but my concern is in what we really mean by data and thalamoclaustral afferents. If you are saying that the claustrum has a priori afferents, and what it is doing really amounts to coordinating feelings into other, more semantically rich afferents (thoughts, higher order perceptual wholes), then I have no problem with that. If you are saying that the claustrum takes \'data\' and turns it into afferents (actual incoming sensation experiences - not necessarily conscious to the top level of consciousness), then I would ask, why would it do such a thing? Why not perform whatever operations are useful on the data without any kind of afferent experience at all?\r\n\r\nAs for slehar, your hackusations are the same as before, so I refer you to my prior responses.

Why? To make the visible invisible so that we can then somehow see it?

Of your two interpretations the first is what I mean. \r\nA great deal of information processing in the brain is effected by synchronized oscillations at a wide range of different frequencies. The claustrum has bilateral connections with almost all the cortex and many subcortical areas, including much of the limbic system that deals with motivation and emotions. The interior of the claustrum consists of a fairly uniform and dense array of pyramidal cells and a syncytium of GABAergic interneurons, all packed together like sardines. Its afferent inflow is topographically distributed thoughout this syncytium. Most neurocomputations related to consciousness are based on extended neural networks that need to talk to each other in a dynamic system of NCCs that underwrite the swift and ever-changing flow of sensations, thoughts, feelings and actions that form a consciousness. \r\n(Remember that the brain generates only  NCCs. The relation of these NCCs to experiential events is another story. Phenomenal events may be identical to NCCs (as in the Identity Theory): or they may be non-identical correlates (as in the Smythies-Carr hypothesis) .\r\n\r\nThe interaction of all these NCCs is effected in the first instance by weak intracortical connections. For example, in a task that involves audiovisual coordination, the neurons in each cortex carrying this task-related activity start to synchronize their oscillations and to align their frequencies. This synchronization in the first instance depends on weak corticocortical connections between two areas of cortex that are widely separated. However, each cortical area also sends axons to the claustrum. Here the â€˜auditory task â€™ neurons are packed close to the â€˜visual taskâ€™ neurons. This makes the synchronization more powerful. This process extends to any cortical areas that are conjointly involved in any task. This includes the emotional, motivational and motor systems. \r\n\r\nLong distance information transfer in the brain is carried by vastly complex spatiotemporal patterns of spikes in axons. These patterns reflect inter alia the patterns of synchronization of the parent neurons of these axons. The information to and from the claustrum is carried by these spike trains. However, inside the claustrum, the information is carried largely by dendrodendritic connections, as well as by the GABAergic syncytium that uses electrical synapses. Both support a population of complex intraclaustral synchronized oscillations that compete for dominance. It is important to realize that the claustrum does not â€˜readâ€™ the incoming axonal codes. It merely provides a forum and mechanism for their competitive interaction that determines the content of the final executive signal sent to the motor cortex. No little green man!\r\n','2012-07-09 17:52:40','2012-07-09 17:52:40'),(2281,96,48,'Thanks John,\r\n\r\nVery intriguing. Let me throw out a few questions to you and pose a couple of ideas (because some folks here can\'t seem to get enough of my ideas :D). I ask these perception-neurology questions of you only because I\'m lazy and am hoping to get answers closer to the \'equine oral cavity\' as it were if you happen to know them.\r\n\r\n1. In the recent study on psilocybin http://www.nature.com/news/psychedelic-chemical-subdues-brain-activity-1.9878 (and others like it if there are any), do you know if the overall activity is decreased in the brain or whether the decrease in the activity in core areas is partially compensated for by increases in other areas less frequently used?\r\n\r\nEither way I think the experiments give credence to Huxley\'s intuition that the brain is a reducing valve, but I think that an overall decrease would have implications for the hard problem - namely that the brain is involved only in the organization of consciousness, the spatiotemporal splitting and eliding of whole experiences (which could extend over large ranges of time - lifetimes even, allowing for synchronicity and more exotic phenomenal occurrences).\r\n\r\n2. Do you know if the processing of 3-D images (stereoptically observed external objects and or intentionally imagined 3-D visual experiences) is associated with more NCC activity or less than that of comparable 2-D images? \r\n\r\nThe reason that I ask is that I have noticed that if I close one eye and look at a flat photo, soon I will begin to see 3-D depth to it. I have a fairly substantial astigmatism so I don\'t know if my experience is common or not (some people who I ask say they have the same effect, but not everyone).\r\n\r\nIs the 3-D effect an example of my brain working harder to give everything depth that it can in the absence of the other eye, or is it actually easier for the brain to assume everything has depth and that this is really a default volumetric projection qualia of human vision which takes work to inhibit in the perception of flat surfaces? Just curious, but again, if the 3-D is easier for the brain, that would support more of a holistic top-down meta-correlate of neurology (MCM) in addition to the interplay of discrete bottom-up NCCs.\r\n\r\nI like your Smythies-Carr hypothesis quite a bit - actually I feel like I can plug it in seamlessly to my own (I can hear the groans in advance). Not that you asked, but here are some possibilities that I would be interested to see if you have considered.\r\n\r\nIn your description it says \"These organized events, for one individual person, are located in a 3D space of their own (\"phenomenal space\") (A) external to common physical space (B). A and B are different cross-sections (or branes) of a higher-dimensional space (the bulk).\"\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest here is a radical reformulation which is anchored in the orthogonal symmetry of A and B rather than the mere separation of the two as nominally distinct but otherwise arbitrarily divided cross-sections. How this goes is that (A) is not a phenomenal space, but rather it is (Ab) - phenomenal time (space) and (B) is not common physical space but inter-phenomenal space(time) or (Ba). \r\n\r\nWhat this does is provide a path from the figurative motives we experience consciously to the literal behaviors which are orchestrated throughout the nervous system in efferent control (of mental attention, intention, volition, etc - again over long periods of time, as in \'I\'m trying to become a doctor\' is a long term phenomenological motive which is expressed in many efferent events over many years). That explains part of how free will works - it is feelings, being, doing as serial translations into public space what is subjectively manifested as a temporal-participatory fugue - ie a pure semantic narrative having limited or no spatial dimension (even figuratively there is no meaningful role that space plays - but \'place\' does play a role metaphorically...but that\'s a whole other kettle of fish). This narrative is concretely and physically real, only orthogonal to public matter-energy-space descriptions. It is the private sense-motive-time origination of descriptions; a warm soft fiction from which cold hard facts emerge (and vice versa...Abâ†”Ba).\r\n\r\nWhat all this means is that while we can productively look as synchronizations of oscillations of NCC, if we want to understand consciousness itself, we should flip it upside down and see the NCCs not as synchronizations that bind data streams but as the end result of experientially coherent solitude that is being broken out across space in many different levels of (Ba) description: Molecules, cells, tissues, the brain as a whole, the body, and body\'s environment. Does this make any sense at all to you?\r\n\r\nIf it does, I think it is the tip of the iceberg which has real implications for psychology, physics and information theory which I can only begin to scratch the surface. Even so, I think that flipping perception around like this is key. This way NCCs are not merely a feed forward system that has an inexplicably conscious target (which I still see as being a homunculus in what you are describing...you\'re just calling it a motor cortex instead) but a bi-directional, involuted (mind in brain and brain in mind) nested dual aspect (Ab mind = non-dual, Ba matter = dualistic, mind looking at matter, mind looking at mind) monism based in \'sense\'.\r\n\r\nThe parallel universe you describe is right here, only we experience it directly and privately rather than the universe of public space which we experience indirectly as a quantitatively flattened (objectified) observation. This means that it is not colliding branes but eliding stories which can have brane-like shadows in the (Ba) interphenomenal representation.','2012-07-09 22:07:30','2012-07-09 22:07:30'),(2284,96,48,'Hi M.R.\r\nIn answer to your two questions, in a system as modular as the brain overall activity may not be a good guide as to what is going on. One has to focus on what the bits are doing. \r\n\r\nI have suggested elsewhere (in the SPR journal) that Bergsonâ€™s filter is constituted by the brainâ€™s glutaminergic NMDA receptors. This is based on the fact that ketamine (an NMDA receptor blocker) can produce all the phenomena of an NDE. So is the NDE merely a set of drug-induced hallucinations? If so, we have to ask why does it produce just those very specific NDE experiences? There is no plausible physiological answer to that question. The alternative explanation is that one normal function of NDE-mediated activity in the brain is to inhibit the spontaneous activity of the psyche, as Huxley suggested. This hypothesis can be tested by seeing if subjects under ketamine develop the 5th dimensional perceptions described by the French physician Jean-Pierre Jourdan. He found that some of his subjects, during an ordinary NDE, saw the physical world from a 5th dimensional perspective: just as we see Flatland from a 3 dimensional perspective. This enabled them to see inside closed boxes and what was going on in the next room, etc..

I have some specific questions for you, Steve, and any other neuroscientists out there, so I wanted to start up a new thread on this topic, if thatâ€™s OK.\r\n\r\nYou talk about the Neural Correlates of Consciousness, or NCCs.  Iâ€™m wondering, in your experience with all these neural scientists, how much do they understand about these NCCs, and how much interest is there in such?  For what interest there is in them, what is it, exactly, that they think they are looking for, or testing for and how are they looking for or testing for these NCCs?\r\n\r\nFor example, when I heard about the now famous [http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2011/09/22/brain-movies/ Jack Gallant, making color movies, reading the minds of people watching movies], I contacted him to find out exactly what their movies of the brain were seeing.  I was totally surprised and disappointed that the movies were false colored by them.  Basically Jack Gallant had no idea about color quale theory, as we are capturing in this survey, and he admitted that he had no interest in such.  Like most neural scientists, they seem only interested in stuff they can test for, and immediately turn off when you mention the word qualia.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Stuart Hameroff (the anesthesiologist), only seems to be looking for experience, as a hole (what disappears, when he puts people to sleep on the operating table.)  His interest in NCCs seems to be at this level, not at something much more specific like what is it that is the NCC for redness vs. greenness, and is there any diversity in such between, us, for example.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that nobody really knows how to look for or test for NCCs, and nobody is even attempting, or even thinking about such?\r\n\r\nThere seems to already be clear expert consensus out there (for which there is emerging evidence for here at Canonizer.com) for a lot of things like qualia are important, and qualia are properties of the final result of the perception process.  The only remaining controversial issue is what is the relationship between these NCCs, and the experiences of things like redness vs greenness.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the only major expert consensus disagreement is split between a few major competing theories about this relationship between what we experience and the NCCs of such.  As you pointed out:\r\n\r\n    â€œPhenomenal events may be identical to NCCs\r\n    (as in the Identity Theory): or they may be non-identical\r\n    correlates (as in the Smythies-Carr hypothesis)â€\r\n\r\nwhich is the major split.  Also, within mind brain identity, the two competing major sub theories are [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/8 â€œFunctional Property Dualismâ€], favored by Chalmers, and [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/7 Material Property Dualism], favored by Hameroff.  In other words, there is consensus on everything except deciding between these 3 main yet to be falsified theories.\r\n\r\nThe current [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6 RQT camp statement] describes 3 different ways to â€˜effâ€™ the ineffable, or ways to know if my redness is anything like your redness.  In other words, it is predicting that this is the way to look for NCCs, which nobody seems to realize yet?\r\n\r\nWe are in the process of moving these â€˜effingâ€™ ideas, and describing them in more detail in new versions of the following camps:\r\n\r\n* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gginaif0YTvDVSwFF7V_wRei-SDZlelt0LPIc5I_gD8/edit Property Dualism]\r\n* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dogSoCsouz2RhQ-CTNjtnYJ8Xr6JILNDki5Kn_met_o/edit Material Property Dualism]\r\n* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V03WBMSY5cKf97NoM6KPZSKtxEEHg5MZJfb6FPq0Ui0/edit Macro Material Property Dualism]\r\n\r\nGiven such methods of â€˜effingâ€™ the ineffable, it seems to me it should be trivially easy to test for which of these 3 main theories is the correct one, and eventually find the real NCCs of redness, and so on â€“ falsifying and forcing all mistaken experts into whatever theoryâ€™s camp is the one.\r\n\r\nHave you seen any evidence that anyone is thinking about looking for what it is, in the brain, that is responsible for my redness, and how to tell if my redness is more like someone elseâ€™s greenness, or possibly someoneâ€™s redness is nothing like someone else has ever experienced before?  In other words, is anyone thinking of testing for any possible diversity of ways our brain experiences something like â€˜redâ€™, and so on?\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2012-07-10 21:30:47','2012-07-10 21:30:47'),(2290,96,48,'Brent,\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the effability issue is a red herring.

I would suggest to you though, that what the strawberry is \'really\' like is not \'really\' an askable question, as the strawberry itself is only presented as a strawberry to certain kinds of perceivers. Any animal may perceive a berry in roughly the same way that you do - a sweet juicy blob that smells fruity. Other organisms may not perceive that at all - bacteria, other plants, etc. An inanimate object that we use as an instrument is only detecting resistance to velocity, temperature, etc. The berry is a qualitatively flat field of purely physical characteristics.

There is no possible theory of NCCs that will ever predict something like a new primary color quale. Neuroscience can tell us how many primary colors we see, or why colors might appear complementary or opposite, or any number of quantitative measures about color, but none of those will *ever* be able to predict exactly what the color xellow might look like. Until you understand why that is not a speculation but a clear statement of fact, I am certain that I am not the one who doesn\'t fully understand qualia.\r\n\r\nCraig Weinberg','2012-07-11 12:14:50','2012-07-11 12:14:50'),(2299,96,48,'Hi Craig,\r\n\r\nYou say nothing could be simpler, yet always talk in ambiguous ways such as \"an infant can know what red is\".\r\n\r\n650NM light is reflected off of the strawberry, whether we are there or not.  Redness, can be there, whether the strawberry is there or not.  As is proved, by the fact that a \"red\" / \"green\" inverter can be added anywhere along the perception process, proves that the two are completely arbitrary, and to talk model any perception process as if they were the same thing is just irrational.\r\n\r\nAlso, you indicated that you think \'effing\' of the ineffable will be possible, within your theory, then you contradict this with things like: \"you can\'t\" know what the near death person experienced \"you aren\'t them\".  So is effing possible or not?\r\n\r\nAlso, I addressed this issue of not being able to experience everything any one person experiences with a quale, like redness, when all the memory of, and attached emotions and everything are bound into the experience to make it complete, in the \"Reduction to the Right Fundamental Level\" section of the [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I94L7QW4STfLlAm2OXYWQVhVfNmKduASBgf3hySy8DM/edit Effing of the ineffable] paper.  Of course, in order to experience the entire thing, including all the memory, and semantic meaning, you\'d have to duplicate much of the other person\'s brain, and as you say, become that person\'s experience.  But prediction is that these complete pictures of experiences can all be broken down, and reduced to fundamental qualities which our brain uses to \'paint\' them with.  And this is what we\'ll be able to easily share / eff, not the entire experience. (at least not without duplication of everything that makes the entire picture/experience)\r\n\r\nYou say: \"there are no NCCs\" and \"There is no possible theory of NCCs that will ever predict something like a new primary color quale.\", which is good to know.  Because MPD is predicting the opposite.  Of course, if science demonstrates this to be the case, you\'ll have to eat your words, to say nothing of your claim that your being right is already a \'fact\', even before there is any demonstrable evidence one way or the other.\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n\r\n','2012-07-12 02:03:39','2012-07-12 02:03:39'),(2302,96,48,'Hi Brent,\r\n\r\n\"You say nothing could be simpler, yet always talk in ambiguous ways such as \"an infant can know what red is\". \"\r\n\r\nWhy is that ambiguous? Infants know simple things. Red is simple and direct. The concept of frequency modulation and electromagnetism are abstract cognitive experiences which an infant would not know. They cannot have the direct experience of 650nm light but they have the experience of red, which is what we can call a visual qualia.\r\n\r\n\"650NM light is reflected off of the strawberry, whether we are there or not. \"\r\n\r\nYes but it\'s not that simple. I agree that there is something physically occurring whether *we* are there or not, but I don\'t think that it is \'light\' any more than it is \'heat\'. Those terms refer to experiential qualia, not objective characteristics. What is objective is unclear as anything that we use to measure electromagnetic oscillations in matter is also made of matter so it is impossible to say whether there is actually an emission of photons from a source and a collision to the sensor or whether it just looks like that because there is a mathematical continuity between what we observe of the behavior of both the emitter and sensor. We have no first hand experience of what a nanometer scale detection instrument \'sees\', we only know what is seems to do.\r\n\r\nThat\'s my conjecture though - I don\'t ask you to consider that as a possibility if you don\'t want to, although I think it makes a lot more sense than the consensus model of literal particle interaction and solves the explanatory gap. If you look at it my way, there is no reflection of light unless there is something to receive and interpret the event as a reflection. If you felt the 650nm \'light\' as heat or as sweetness instead, there would be no sense of reflection and it would be impossible to tell whether the strawberry was warm from the sun/light bulb or generating the heat by itself non-reflectively. \r\n\r\nWe agree that qualia cannot be assumed to be immutably bound to an physical referents or automatically generated consequences of them..data has no sensory preference as we know from computer files. You say the relation is completely arbitrary, and I almost agree, but I only say that they are not directly related - they may very well be indirectly related through sense. Sense allows us the possibility of penetrating our solipsistic bubble, not to contact an absolute reality, but to internalize greater and more inclusively true experiences than just the self, mind, or brain, can generate.\r\n\r\nLet\'s look at it your way though and say that 650nm \"light\" does not require any receiver and independently exists in a way that red does not. What would be the point, from a functional perspective, of turning that light into something other than what it is? If your visual system can capture the pattern of light to begin with, why turn it into some magical modeling in a new dimension of \'color\'? In order to generate a coherent spectrum of color, where red plus blue equals purple for example, and red light plus green light equals yellow light but red paint plus green paint equals grey-brown paint. That is a lot of sense to make out of a \'completely arbitrary\' hocus pocus. It\'s rather a stretch to imagine that this is a pin-the-tail-on-the-quanta \'representation\' - clearly important truths about light on many levels are revealed with an effectiveness and elegance that our quantitative models have not equaled. If you had to choose whether to understand everything about what your eyes are seeing from a scientific perspective but be blind, ie if you could have X-ray vision and infrared vision, radio vision, etc but have to have that vision only as understood knowledge and information, would you choose that instead of being able to see? Would you go blind in order to have superhuman blindsight? If not, why not? The answer explains the difference between qualia and quanta.\r\n\r\n\"Also, you indicated that you think \'effing\' of the ineffable will be possible, within your theory, then you contradict this with things like: \"you can\'t\" know what the near death person experienced \"you aren\'t them\". So is effing possible or not? \"\r\n\r\nYes, it is probably possible if you connect your brain to another person\'s brain. I never said that is isn\'t possible at some point to merge with another person, just as brain conjoined twins are merged. Sense provides with something even better though - intuition, inference, imagination. Infinitely richer for the universe. Instead of one set of qualia per universe, or one per person, you have each person being able to imagine what others qualia might be like if they want to - and they might even be right, or have valid insights about it.\r\n\r\n\"But prediction is that these complete pictures of experiences can all be broken down, and reduced to fundamental qualities which our brain uses to \'paint\' them with. \"\r\n\r\nThat contradicts what you just said though, which I agree with, that qualia is shaped by experience. Proof: http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-07-deaf-brain-differently.html\r\n\r\nIf there were complete pictures of experiences which could be reduced, then we would expect to just give an ordinary five year old a calculus book and give them a heavy dose of the neurotransmitters associated with understanding in the areas of the brain associated with mathematics and expect the calculus to become understood without benefit of any experience to get from ignorance to expertise. That is not going to happen. Symbol grounding problem is the key to why. Forms do not automatically generate contents. Formation is not information without sense to interpret it as such. That interpretation is a physical event through time which is experiential and private for which no substitute will suffice. You might be able to speed it up relative to external inertial frames of time measurement so that you can experience something like a slowdown of time while you spend a month learning calculus in your experience with only five minutes elapsed time...maybe that can happen, but not because we force feed the brain a finished configuration. It would be like trying to heat a house by turning logs in the fireplace into ashes directly. You can\'t skip the subjective experience.\r\n\r\n\"There is no possible theory of NCCs that will ever predict something like a new primary color quale.\", which is good to know. Because MPD is predicting the opposite. \"\r\n\r\nIt\'s like a drunk in a bar predicting that he is going to win a fight though. MPD has no way of even defining the actual content of a color (or any other) quale, so there is no danger of it ever being able to predict what a new one would or could look like. What is the prediction based on? Promissory vapor. Why does MPD have any credibility whatsoever in delivering anything more than it already has? What progress can a blind person make in discovering the blueness of blue?

Iâ€™ve always just naively waived my hand over that issue, and you noticed I even  ignored you asking about it â€“ so thanks for perusing this issue further as I definitely need to think about this more thoroughly.  This amplification of the wisdom of all of us process is so helpful along these lines.  Itâ€™s launching us all, collectively, way beyond anything the Ivory Tower and their already more than 20K pile of \"peer reviewed\" publication is producing â€“ donâ€™t you think?\r\n\r\nMy previous naive thinking was there is some kind of spiritual stuff in some other spiritual dimension â€“ or something.  And that this stuff has spiritual causes and effects that communicate back and forth with the brain in some way.  Descartes idea was that this communication takes place through the penal gland.  Modern versions usually postulate some kind of quantum weirdness or string theory brane causes and effects, or something, for this causal interface.\r\n\r\nBut I guess, if you think of it rigorously, the best way to define it is â€œDo qualia, or whatever has these phenomenal qualities, have any cause/effect behavior in reality, beyond classical causal physics, or beyond what is observable via objective or abstracted cause and effect based observation?â€\r\n\r\nProperty dualism, and especially Material Property Dualism, says no.  Qualities are just ineffable fundamental qualities of something we already know, behaviorally, and abstractedly, all about.  Its all the same stuff, just two ways to know about it: abstracted information about it\'s behavior, and fundamental qualitative or quale information.\r\n\r\nSo you are saying that you are \"atheist\" about any type or quality of consciousness existing outside the brain, or is it just \"consciousness in its entirety\" existing outside of the brain?

Use of the misleading term \'qualia\' obscures this simple notion. The relations between the events in the physical brain and the phenomenal events in a consciousness are spatial (higher-dimensional) and causal.

If neuroscience is to have any relation to the world as it is, then we must have a theory of how we get to that point using only the solipsitic simulations that we have.

By beginning with the very assumption that both materialism and idealism lead to self-fulfilling pathologies that mischaracterize each other, I build a self-conscious hypothesis of the precise relation between interior and exterior realism.\r\n\r\nMy conclusions at this point is that our interior realism is not a hyperdimensional space which exists in a separate realm but is actually a single deep dimension which \'insists\' in the same universe as neuroscience\'s does, but it is not a dimension of spaces but rather *the* dimension of time. Who we are is time makers. Our experiences charge temporal vectors with perceptual-participatory (sense-motive) significance that could not be achieved otherwise, transforming the relentlessly granular and meaningless snapshots of meaningless structure into holistic narratives.

This evidence comes from a series of experiments that show that, as I said earlier, we perceive a mixture of what us actually â€˜out thereâ€™ and what the brain computes is most probably â€˜out thereâ€™.\r\nRamachandran and his colleagues carried out the first set of these experiments. They showed that scotomata â€” the blind patches caused by local injury if not too large â€” are not perceived as patches of nothing, but that the brain fills them in with a continuation of whatever pattern surrounds them (Ramachandran and Blakeslee, 1998). In addition KovÃ¡cs, Papathomas, Yand and FehÃ©r (1996) have produced further evidence. These workers took two photographs, one of a mon- keyâ€™s face and the second of a leafy tropical jungle. They converted these into two pastiches each composed of portions of each photo, so that in the location where one photo showed part of the monkeyâ€™s face the other showed leafy jungle. Then each pastiche was shown separately to each retina, so that retinal rivalry occurred. Under these circumstances, the subject did not see what was actually there â€” that is the two pastiches alternating â€” but rather a complete monkey face alternating with a complete leafy jungle. Clearly the brain had suppressed the improbable mixed pastiche in favor of what it was familiar with (and thus computed to be more probable). Many other experiments, based on stimuli such as moving plaid patterns, have shown this phenomenon, where the perception of an improbable input is suppressed by the brain, and replaced with the perception of what it computes to be a more probable one (see e.g. Ramachandran and Anstis, 1983).\r\nOther crucial experiments (Kleiser, Seitz and Krekelberg, 2004) have shown that, during a saccade (rapid movement of the eye), information coming from the eye is suppressed, and what we see is largely virtual reality created by the brain with little recourse to the retinal input. These authors expressed it thus: â€˜When you look into a mirror and move your eyes left to right, you will see that you cannot observe your own eye movements. This demonstrates the phenomenon of saccadic suppression: during saccadic eye movements, visual sensitivity is much reduced.â€™ In other words, â€˜filling inâ€™ has a temporal as well as a spatial dimension. This function is based on a widespread neural network, which includes the superior colliculus and parts of the thalamus. The purpose of this would appear to be to suppress the violent swings in the visual input (the world swirling round one) and resulting severe vertigo that would otherwise result. Since saccades occur very frequently, this means that virtual reality plays a role in normal everyday seeing.â€\r\n\r\nThese experimental results are easily explicable in terms of the Representative Theory, but not, I suggest, by any â€œalternative worldsâ€ theory.\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n\r\n\r\n','2012-07-15 16:49:31','2012-07-15 16:49:31'),(2344,96,48,'Hi John,\r\n\r\nYou indicated you support Substance Dualism, and possibly belong in a different camp.

My view is that this should not by itself be construed as evidence that top-down contributions to perception are computationally derived or are in any way less \'real\' than bottom up processes.\r\n\r\nIn particular, when you say \"Clearly the brain had suppressed the improbable mixed pastiche in favor of what it was familiar with (and thus computed to be more probable).\" I do not see that the kinds of experiments you mention (and forgive me if there is a counterfactual to what I am about to say) positively point specifically to a computation of probabilities or that such a computation is being performed by the brain. I am not opposed to the idea that could be part of what is going on, I just don\'t see how it helps us get from a brain process which matches invisible data criteria to a presentation of whole visual experiences.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would not jump to any conclusions about computation based on the fact that our perception favors established signal content over unsolicited noise content, only that we have a nose for what matters which is reflected on all levels of our perception. If pushed to decide between signal and noise, we have the latitude to drop spatial or temporal realism in favor of preserving the signal. This does not, in my book, mean that our perception is not a direct realism, only that it has limitations, especially when presenting a fragmented environment that has been contrived to defeat the unity of subjectivity.\r\n\r\nFor neuroscience and the Easy Problem of Consciousness, I agree this kind of research is important to tease out the capacities of our brain\'s ability to deliver a properly conditioned presentation of interior and exterior realism, however I don\'t think it helps us with the Hard Problem. We are assuming representation from the start by using what we know to be optical representations to begin with. We are already taking our own word for the fact that a picture of something is a copy of that thing in some objective and universal way. Especially if our perception were, as I think you are suggesting, mere representation, that assumed universality would be a scientific loose end. \r\n\r\nJust as our perception elides the obstacles presented by noise to extract signal, our assumption that images are actually tied to their referents independently of subjectivity is not strong enough to justify conclusions about consciousness overall. By hiding our cognitive bias with one hand so that we can expose it bias with the other, we are ultimately chasing out tail and missing what I call the Elephant in Every Room. Neuroscience can only be a chain of perceptions grouped together by analytical perceptions, so that anything it says that can be used to cast doubt on the fundamental realism of perception must also cast doubt on our own ability to use neuroscience to learn anything fundamentally real about anything. As Raymond Tallis might say, it saws off the limb it is sitting on.\r\n\r\nCraig','2012-07-16 00:46:44','2012-07-16 00:46:44'),(2353,96,48,'Excellent idea all round Brent! \r\n\r\nJohn','2012-07-16 04:41:26','2012-07-16 04:41:26'),(2356,96,48,'Brent\r\n\r\nSo, as i understand you (post #186), you started off with substance dualism and proceeded to property dualism via Cartesian dualism?\r\n\r\nYes, i believe that the NCC is exclusively brain (or similar system) activity so all the varieties of panpsychism are mistaken IMO.\r\n\r\n\"Let me ask you if you think there is any possibility that there is more to the surface of the strawberry, than just its ability to behave in a way that it reflects 650 NM light?\"\r\nOf course: it has many properties, not just interaction with light.\r\n\r\n\"Is the strawberry in any way ineffably qualitative or phenomenal?\"\r\nNo. It is a delectable fruit composed of water, sugars and so on.\r\n\r\n\"Obviously, we both agree that something in the brain has more than just behavior which can be simulated, right?\"\r\nSo we agree that computational functionalism - the theory that consciousness is some form of computation - is false?\r\n\r\nThere is a range of computer simulations of aspects of neurons and neural networks which more or less replicate measurements taken from the brain and they are being improved all the time as are the instruments of measurement.

Not everything can eat fruit, so there is no reason to believe that the distinction between fruit, vegetable, mineral, delectableness, etc could exist in the absence of an entity which could potentially be interested in eating the thing. In a universe where strawberries were the only living organisms, it would be much more likely IMO that soil would be delectable and the idea of a fruit would have no meaning. If we are to understand consciousness we cannot fail to include the prospective view - starting from the ground up of a universe without consciousness.\r\n\r\nAs to the next level of description of \'water\' and \'sugars\', this is a bit more challenging to view prospectively but the idea is the same. Water and sugar are molecular arrangements of atoms which have no particular meaning unless they are part of some view of the world which reads them as meaningfully patterned atoms. Otherwise they are nothing but nano-pinpoints of mass clinging together out of mathematical habit, with no macro level of description at all. They move around at different speeds, break apart, stick together, etc, but at no point does it become a given that these \'arrangements\' exist as identifiable wholes in and of themselves. \r\n\r\nGoing down further of course, the atoms themselves are what?

Potentials for qualitative elaboration?\r\n\r\nMy conclusion then is that all possible descriptions and identities on all levels can be nothing other than qualia. Nothing is anything except the total of all possible experiences of what it seems to be (to itself and to everything else). Panpsychism, or pan-experientialism is the only way I can see that really makes sense as we can get an appearance of dumbed down reality by inhibiting sensitivity or flattening qualitative depth, but we cannot make reality more intelligent by moving dumb components around in more elaborate circles.\r\n\r\nAnyone getting more of an idea of what I am talking about?\r\n\r\nCraig','2012-07-16 15:01:26','2012-07-16 15:01:26'),(2361,1,37,'John\r\n\r\nI agree with Mark - why take the phenomenal space literally and so invoke higher dimensions when it fits within the brain as an EM phenomenon?\r\n\r\n','2012-07-16 15:05:42','2012-07-16 15:05:42'),(2362,1,32,'In his 1989 book Penrose says that he also sees randomness as useless for human understanding.

You stated: â€œcomputational functionalism - the theory that consciousness is some form of computation - is false.â€\r\n\r\nI think I disagree with this, but Iâ€™m not sure what this implies you think consciousness is so let me see if I can get you to help me understand your thinking on this.\r\n\r\nI think computation can be done on top of any fundamental natures of reality; â€˜causal propertiesâ€™ being one of the two types of fundamental natures.  Current Computers all run on these types of properties, exclusively (as in nothing is dependent on any phenomenal natures), in abstracted ways.  In other words, a set of causal properties, such as a group of wires with either zero or 5 volts can be interpreted as a string of bits, which in turn can be interpreted as a pattern of 0xFF0000, which in turn can be interpreted as â€˜redâ€™ which in turn can be interpreted as a property of a strawberry.  And this pattern of causal properties, can then, because of this interpretation, cause the robot to choose to pick the strawberry.\r\n\r\nTo me, that is all computation.\r\n\r\nWe, on the other hand, are still doing similar computation.  Our brain is just also running our computations on top of phenomenal natures, not just causal natures exclusively.  In other words, in the last example, it was the set of wires with 0xFF0000 pattern of voltages that was causing the computational system to choose to pick the strawberry.  While we, on the other hand, are choosing to pick the strawberry because of its redness phenomenal quality.  In other words, it is this redness nature that is causing the computational system to pick the strawberry.\r\n\r\nRobot computation is entirely based on abstracted information.  The only thing that needs to know anything about fundamental natures, are the transducers that cause one representation to transducer to the next causally downstream abstracted representation.  While for us, the fundamental natures are part of the algorithm, and it is because we know what it is fundamentally like, i.e. redness, that we make the computational action of picking it.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you think differently, in that consciousness is something, different, entirely, from any kind of computation?

The reason is that the instruments 1) are not conscious and 2) are making measurements of electrical potential and the like. The latter is what stops us from observing qualia: all we see are e.g. the pictures displaying blood flow contours.\r\n\r\n\"And you seem to agree that we will be able to discover these qualities of various different types of such \'electromagnetic phenomenon\' despite this quale interpretation problem?\"\r\nIf you\'re trying to tell me that a quale is a bit pattern then forget it.\r\n\r\n\"And if so, would you think there is some better way to refer to achieving, and knowing what they are like, than \'effing the ineffable\'?\"\r\nLook, the way to see through another\'s eyes is to connect the brains appropriately.

In one he provided a reference to [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaCedh4Dfs4 his recent talk] at the \"Evolution and Function of Consciousness\" conference.  He indicated that he talks about the issue we raised in the open letter in that talk.  He also describes there an update to his multiple drafts model, which I think is enough to start a \'camp\' with - especially since James (and others) seem to agree that this is very much like their way of thinking about consciousness.\r\n\r\nThis talk is very convincing to me, that he is (at least now, thanks to Lehar\'s work?)  very much a representationalist, not a direct perceptionist as some of us have assumed (I point a few of the time references in the video which prove such in the proposed Dennett statement google doc below).  He very much accepts how powerful arguments are for Dualism, yet just like James, warns us against going down that path, for not quite as good as reasons as James provides (in my opinion)  \r\n\r\nI think we could get his camp started just like we started Hameroff\'s Orch OR theory camp.  Just like you gracious supporters of Hameroff showed up to help his noble effort.  Hameroff thought his camp was far less popular than it now demonstrably is, and it seems that Dennett thinks his camp has become far less popular than I bet it is, despite his up till now disinterest.  I\'m betting that more supporters will soon show up to support what is surely a far more popular camp than he thinks, despite his absence.\r\n\r\nDennett also talks about tactics in this field, that losing interest in publishing for a time was a tactical mistake.  I\'m hoping we can quickly demonstrate to him the power of the amplification of the wisdom of the crowd canonizer tactics.  Whenever I give a talk, I always ask what people think.  If they support the ideas, I ask them to support the camps that represent them.  And if they think differently, I ask everyone to \'canonize\' such, so if there really is something to such, we can all better understand, concisely and quantitatively, just what that is.  Surely, if anyone as popular as Dennett did anything like this, as they gave talks and published papers, (instead of wasting so much time focusing on non consensus sloppy thinking like \"access vs phenomenal consciousness\") they could likely quickly push their camp to the top of the consensus ladder, at least for a time, since ultimately everything depends on scientific reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, towards that end, I propose we start a sub camp of Representational Functionalism called \"Dennett\'s Predictive Bayesian Coding Theory\" and I have started a proposed Google doc statement here:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1RFwEiuJ2VI_NQOJd3DfkUGifo6L0GGq1z46z4T4i5wc/edit\r\n\r\nI\'m betting that James will think about as much of this proposed camp statement (and name?) as I thought of one of his proposal of property dualism (though such was a great help for me in concisely formulating what we have now).  So I\'m hoping he and others can turn this into a much better version from their perspective.\r\n\r\nThen, hopefully, we can run this by Dennett, one final time, before we canonize it?\r\n\r\nJames and or Michal or anyone, would you be willing to support such a camp to at least get it started?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to finding out what everyone thinks.

I think that this mischaracterization stems from the application of object oriented assumptions to what is non-objective by nature. Not non-physical, but non-objective, as in, a capacity of presence through private experience rather than a representation as functions of bodies in space or pseudo-substantial concepts which take metaphors like ether and energy literally to be subjectively charged spatial fields in a vacuum.\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest is that our native experience of consciousness, though perhaps a difficult example to try to use as a basis to model awareness or sense in general, is irreducibly correct in it\'s presentation. The self is neither a thing nor not a thing, but rather the participation in and perception of particular things. Rather than presuming to reduce this personal state to impersonal micro-states of cellular and molecular bodies, or impersonal macro-states of evolutionary process, I propose a perpendicular axis which capitulates a spectrum of sub-personal and super-personal experiences. \r\n\r\nThis means that our emotions or thoughts are not \'made of\' neurological \'signals\' or neurotransmitter activity, but rather those impersonal micro and macro layers of description are the public extension in space of what is privately \'intended\' through personal, sub-personal, and super-personal convergences through time. No glowing energy fields or incorporeal ghosts, just signifying experiences. Stories in which irreducibly direct participation takes place on many levels at the same time. These stories are concretely physical in the sense of being associated with physical bodies on every scale, and causally so. We can cause the chemistry of our brain to change and our body to move at will, but are directly influenced by our brain and body as well. There is bi-directional interaction on all levels, so that micro-impersonal cellular states influence super-personal states of consciousness, and vice versa, etc. \r\n\r\nEach category of states defines itself in its own terms as well as in the terms defined by its place in the continuum of all of the other states and modalities.

Having certain contributions in other scientific social networks, I was in search of such a network which is itself motivating, intellectually prominent, and free of homophily and social discrimination as well encompassing a wide ranging audience discussing every possible issues which can be found till I got the reference of Canonizer.com which genuinely suited my quest. I believe my deep rooted interest would definitely find some good audience and support, and in turn, I would genuinely extend my full support to this wonderful platform and the people behind this initiative who have created such a wonderful knowledge propagating podium to express whatever comes in my mind and taps my aptitude, and to those active participants who bring in new knowledge to illuminate our inquisitive mind.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I noted while joining this knowledge network is that, it is though much like wiki, but with a different savor which is truly innovative where one is free to put down anything on mind and no matter whatever on the paper to further the cause of knowledge generation and value creation by engaging, or agreeing on what that is justifiable, or have much freedom to put forth argument for any such disagreement. The platform seems open to contention and through further agreement or disagreement, the pure refinement of the theories would filter and purify the knowledge shared by and among us, the active members.\r\n\r\nThe topic which I have proposed is regarding a very contentious issue relating to the theory of machine thinking which I believe is now at its formative years where there is much to do and a great deal of things to explore. On the realms of hedonistic imperatives of AI, the philosophy of this subject had a wonderful beginning as we know from the contributions from Turing, Herbert Simon and Allen Newell, McCarthy, Minsky and other great stalwarts to what it is today, a more matured field wide open for further exploration and development. The marriage of different domains of knowledge including cognitive sciences, psychology, computer science, anthropology, and neuroscience has not only strengthened this particular field, but as also, extended the deeper horizon of AI philosophy to aim for something big as \"Machine Thinking\" to bridge the gap between human beings and their machine counterparts using the tools of science. To this end, we dream of something novel like hybrid human-artificial mind or a co-processor for our own brain or even brain augmentation technology, the opportunities are abounding as well interestingly open for exploration both by novice and experts. In the longer run, I hope we would be able to address these critical issues in much wider details for a greater number of audience and experts alike and of certain, to quest further to answer â€œwhat itsâ€™ need and what is needed?â€\r\n\r\nOn this endeavor, I believe Canonizer.com can provide us with that right advantage to excel at our collective quest for deeper knowledge.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks,\r\n\r\nSidharta Chatterjee,\r\nVisiting Researcher,\r\nAndhra University, Visakhapatnam,\r\nIndia.\r\n','2012-11-10 03:51:03','2012-11-10 03:51:03'),(2459,284,14,'Sidharta Chatterjee\r\n\r\nMachine Minds: The Blueprint for Artificial Consciousness\r\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2061949\r\n\r\nAt the Crossroads of Consciousness\r\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2079597\r\n\r\nIdeas RePec\r\nhttp://ideas.repec.org/f/pch767.html\r\n\r\nssrn.com\r\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2079597\r\n\r\nEconPapers\r\nhttp://econpapers.repec.org/RAS/pch767.htm\r\n\r\nMPRA\r\nhttp://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/28883/\r\n\r\nOpendepot\r\nhttp://opendepot.org/483/','2012-11-10 04:48:31','2012-11-10 04:48:31'),(2460,1,64,'\r\nMoral Theoreticians,\r\n\r\nIâ€™d like to welcome theyogre as a contributor to this survey topic; itâ€™s exciting to see this topic grow.

Yet it occurs to me that many of these people speak largely in ancient terms. \r\n\r\nMy personal grasp of liberation has been bolstered by the discoveries of the scientific mindset. In particular, I\'m moved by the theory of evolution, which (for obvious reasons) was not available to The Buddha. The same goes for memetics, quantum mechanics, relativity, cosmology, game theory, hard data (such as we get from fMRI\'s) and so on.\r\n\r\nI\'m not saying such data is indispensable for liberation. It obviously is NOT indispensable, since many people have become liberated without it. However, my â€œquestâ€ for the past 7 years has been to discover if there\'s a way that liberation can be made attainable to a reasonably well-informed person whose main tool is deep honesty, starting with the statement that (it seems to me) is at the heart of the best kinds of scientific inquiry: â€œI might be wrong!â€\r\n\r\nI have noticed that it\'s possible to get too deep into this point of view, attempting to concoct explanations for that which is not explainable from  the vantage point of ape descendants with puny brains.

Those few who do not have that vested interest are incapable of expressing themselves in ordinary language using non-esoteric concepts. \r\n\r\nBack in 2006, when I was 49 years old, I took my first genuinely serious step in my ongoing quest for the truth.

Those memes become an integral part of what we take ourselves to be. A big part of that might include a convenient fiction called God.

For example, our planet simply cannot support energy consumption of six billion people. How to defend then, fierce opposition to birth control? How to defend then, our living standards?

I say types of behaviour pattern because, us people being what we are, variability is normal. \r\n\r\nAs an ex Christian I have real experience of both sides of the divide.\r\n\r\nTrue believers take the word God, or some particular name of their favoured deity, to be the real name of a person-like entity which really does exist. An atheist such as myself is more or less bound to describe the beliefs of true believers as a set of behaviours many of which are private mental behaviours of a particular kind. \r\n\r\nIt is too hard and probably not worth the effort for me to try and pin down the most crucial aspects of true belief, but  I think it is fair to say that naive realism is involved and, necessarily, a set of algorithms which are memes which the believer has taken in at some stage either consciously or not as the case may be. \r\n\r\nAtheists on the other hand do not take the word God, or some ...blah blah .. as real; it is just a concept that is taken far too seriously by the true believers. What atheists believe about the universe in general is not prescribed by any law, and almost none of it is irrefutably provable, except the logical necessity of _not_ engaging in the same kind of true beliefs as the true believers do. \r\n\r\nIt is arguable that an atheist has access to more opportunities to be truly free. I base this assertion on my own assessment of what is critically involved in being human; the summary includes the following: The human universe is always potentially infinite, so long as it exists and we believe it to be so. I think that is possibly the most liberating thought a person can have. It works for me anyway.  It is paradoxical however to the extent that our freedom, the very freedom I think is at issue, depends on our individual courage and willingness to stand by what we believe in. \r\n\r\nThe true believer is likely to say at this point: \"Ha ha! You see!  You have to believe in something! \"  which is true enough but the true believers then seem unable to refrain from inferring that just because it is _possible_ to believe in a divine being therefore it is _better_ to do so. That proposition is pure guesswork however.

For example, you seem to have added a survey questions as a sub camp of the main agreement statement.  If there is a survey question, the best place to put that is usually in the agreement statement, where the purpose of the topic is defined.  The problem is, if I support either the yes or no camp, it implies I don\'t agree with anything in the sibling (i.e. competing) \"Artificial Minds and Synthetic Thoughts\" camp - yet I agree with most of what is over there?\r\n\r\nFinally, it\'s not good to make assumptions about camps that might be competitor ideas to your camp.  It usually best to just start with one petition like camp which you think is the best theory, and start recruiting new supporters - only creating new camps when absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nAs an example, to me a \'robot\' is, by definition, just an abstracted or non phenomenal system.  So, since phenomenal knowledge is required for true \'self consciousness\', it makes it hard for me to join any of the camps.  And I do believe it is possible to create artificial consciousness, I just wouldn\'t call it a robot.  Also, it is possible for a robot to be \'self aware\' in a non phenomenal or non conscious way, but all this kind of detail and such is not possible to specify or survey for in this structure as you currently have it?\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can more concisely state the purpose (remove as much unnecessary stuff as possible) of the topic in the agreement statement, and then just add one camp describing exactly what you currently believe.  Then, if I agree with all that, I can also sign your petition, or join your camp.  Only if there is something we disagree on, (probably some very minor issues) will we need to then negotiate to create two sub camps below the supper camp, representing these minor differences.  That way all the most important stuff and definitions we agree on can be in the supper experts consensus petition camp, along with a good concisely stated survey of the lessor things we disagree with, if any?\r\n\r\nThanks for your continued work to add all this great content to the system!\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2013-01-01 16:22:58','2013-01-01 16:22:58'),(2506,283,22,'Hi Brent,\r\n\r\nThanks for your guidance, I am now able to get easy with the system, initially I thought its bit complicated but now having some  understanding of what it is like.\r\n\r\nJust need to get clear about these things first:\r\n\r\n1.

They use different hardware in their map so\r\nthey are different.\r\n\r\nIf you have two systems, that used all the same abstract information\r\nprocessing, so that it\'s information output was the same for same inputs,\r\nbut used different internal coding, would our qualia be different?\r\n\r\nOr, to make the question easier to understand, lets say you and I had nearly\r\nidentical brains, but due to a genetic difference, my brain encoded redness\r\nwith a glutamate molecule, and your brain used that molecule to encode\r\ngreenness. Would that mean our qualia were inverted?\r\n\r\nSeems intuitively that the answer would be yes. But, the answer, sad to say\r\n(for you), is NO. It can\'t be in that case.\r\n\r\nThis is because if the information processing is the same, then we could\r\nchange the encoding, and the person would then be unable to report that\r\nencoding had changed. If we move software from one computer that encodes 1\'s\r\nwith a +5, to a second computer that encodes the 1\'s with +3, could the\r\nsoftware report that encoding had changed? Not if the information processing\r\nhad stayed the same in the move. The software could not tell us, \"yes I can\r\ntell I\'m running on the +5 version of my qualia now\".\r\n\r\nLikewise, if we switch your brain, to encode red the way my brain encodes\r\nred, would you be able to say, \"I see, your red looks like my green\"? The\r\nanswer is NO you couldn\'t. If we swapped your encoding, it means you would\r\nhave no memory of how it was, to compare to how it is now, to detect the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n','2013-03-06 00:25:30','2013-03-06 00:25:30'),(2518,96,48,'Suppose a child is a born, and he has some sort of permanent set of glasses or cybernetics placed on him so that he sees green when we see red and vice versa...\r\n\r\nHe has this since growing up... so when we see red... he sees green, but he calls it red, because he has no idea our experience is different....

There really is an external reality composed of physical objects (and their movements extending to the extent of complete processes like orbiting a star, etc.).â€\r\n\r\nThere is no support for this from a completely objective point of view. While we can judge that there certainly seems to be a universe which goes on without us being present, there is no reason why we should jump to the conclusion that there is a such a universe which is independent of all beings - of all perception and experience. \r\n\r\nIt should be a clue that when we imagine the universe without perception, we cannot help but imagine a universe exactly as it is from our experience. Atoms are very small, a thousand years is very long, stars are bright, rocks on planets are heavy, etc. Of course, this is complete nonsense. Without a human sized, lifetime scaled phenomenon to serve as the orienting frame of reference, there is no qualitative presentation which can have precedence over any other. Past, future, fast, slow, enormous, tiny, etc... all meaningless. There is no here or there, no way to recognize any distribution of particles as a pattern or any pattern of energy as a particle. Indeed, a universe without an observer is indiscernible from nothing at all. It could only be silent, invisible, intangible. In short, there can be no â€œexternal realityâ€.\r\n\r\nThe second great mistaken assumption about the Hard Problem is that qualia has something to do with representation. It does not. Qualia is presentation. It is the source of all presence. Representation does not need qualia at all. As we have seen, any kind of quality which can be detected by an instrument can be digitized into a generic representation. Qualia would not only be superfluous and unexplainable, it would be an impediment to the transfer of information. \r\n\r\nThe third false assumption in the Hard Problem discussion is derived from the second - after jumping to the conclusion of qualia as representation, the next premature jump extends the metaphor to conscious experience as a model or simulation. If qualia were a representation, an encoded symbol, then it would make sense indeed that a network of symbols (a model) is a good way of describing our experience. \r\n\r\nQuoting Waser:\r\n\r\nâ€œPer Hofstadater [2007], Damasio [2010], and others Llinas [2001], consciousness/self is simply a process running on a physical (â€œstrangeâ€) loop/feedback network created per Richard Dawkinsâ€™ [1976] speculation that â€œperhaps consciousness arises when the brainâ€™s simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itselfâ€.â€\r\n\r\nA natural speculation if you are approaching consciousness from the outside, where it has no qualia or presence and can only be inferred by smuggling in our own knowledge of our own consciousness. Consciousness does rely heavily on feedback loops, but feedback of what? Loopness? Thereâ€™s no physics there, no participation or presence. \r\n\r\nIn reality, what is being looped can only be something which is already sensory or proto-sensory for it to conceivably scale up to the full blown human interiority which we experience. A model need not have any more or an experienced presence than a symbol does. It is simply processed from one encoded form to another and never is there any decoding into a significant experience. Inputs are compared with logical expectations, outputs are produced. I doesn\'t matter whether those outputs are hunting a wild boar or incrementing a memory register. There is no way to assign any visceral realism or qualia to differentiate the two, and of course, none are needed. Critical processes need only be assigned higher priority, not some kind of fireworks display of flavors and colors.\r\n\r\nAs far as the \'is my red your green?\' conversation goes, the confusion is because visual qualia is unusual in that it is presented as the most object-like feeling that we can experience. Red is still a feeling, but it is a visual feeling, which seems to be scoped or tuned toward experiences which convey the third person perspective - detached, fully available to examination as a knowable shape/design/color. It is a feeling which in the most public facing way.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that visual qualia is actually a second order qualia, the first being the feelings that we have *about* the color, or through the color. It is very confusing indeed if we don\'t realize this and conflate both qualia as a single one. From optical experiments we have seen that our visual sense is highly resilient to experimental manipulation, and will quickly route around tricks, such as flipping the image upside down or pushing the chroma median away from true yellow. We get used to it and our visual presentation returns to its inertial norm despite having altered optics.\r\n\r\nCombine these two and we can understand that it is a two way street, with our first order feelings driving the perceptual inertia from the inside out and the second order visual feelings being partially driven by optics. I don\'t know if we all have the same green and red, but if I had to guess, I would say that we have first order feeling qualia which are both more human-universal and personal-idiosyncratic, and second order visual qualia which is more local-physiological-cultural.\r\n\r\nCraig','2013-03-06 02:13:39','2013-03-06 02:13:39'),(2524,96,48,'Talk of encoding qualia in bit patterns assumes that the computational functionalism theory (CF) is true. In addition to physicalism - the mind is instantiated in the brain - CF holds that  the brain is just an information processing system.\r\n\r\nIf CF were true then you could encode a quale as a bit pattern in a computer. Simply envisaged, you could use 1 for red and 2 for blue so a computer system with normal colour processing would output 1 for colour input from a UK post box and 2 for a clear sky. One with an inverted system would output 2 for the box and 1 for sky. But this is arbitrary. Functionally, the two systems are identical yet they output different values for the same input. Therefore CF is false; qualia cannot be data.\r\n\r\nThe inverted qualia argument does not defeat non-functionalist physicalism, however. Yes, the conscious brain is not at all like a computer: qualia are not data, colours are not encoded by bit patterns in the brain. This does not rule out the possibility that consciousness is brain activity, just that it is not information processing.\r\n\r\nI would add that the notion it would be possible to encode information in a glutamate molecule is silly. You can, of course, encode information in DNA sequences but that is because you can change the sequence of bases whereas one glutamate molecule is the same as any other.\r\n\r\n','2013-03-06 09:26:33','2013-03-06 09:26:33'),(2527,96,48,'Proposed consolidation of open Philosophy of Mind issues as aspects of the \"Presentation Problem\" or Unified Presentation Problem (UPP).\r\n\r\nI propose that the Hard Problem, the Explanatory Gap, the Binding Problem, the Symbol Grounding Problem should all be understood as aspects of the same Unified Presentation Problem.\r\n\r\n1.

I know the US, and most of the world is attacking Iran\'s currency.  Is it similar to this?\r\n\r\nIt says: \"Transition to a non-inflationary official national Bitcoin usage by a country could prove to be extremely advantageous for first nation adopters.\"  I could see some ways in which this could be advantageous, such as simply the more any country get\'s in before Bitcoins inflate too much, could increase the wealth of that nation.  But I also see significant possible negatives for a country.  For example, Japan\'s economy has been decimated, for the last 10+ years, because it\'s currency has inflated in value, instead of deflated, like the rest of the world.  They are finally only now recovering, after they are deflating the value of their currency.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned \"Thousand fold\" increases, should the IMF start to hold Bitcoins to help protect member nations, and \"Million Fold\" increases, should it encourage the entire world to adopt Bitcoin is it\'s currency.  Do you realize that \"thousand fold increases\"  make the market cap of Bitcoins more than the Market Cap of all the gold in the world, and the \"Million Fold Increases\" make Bitcoin Market Valuations start to approach the value of all real estate, in the world?  That almost seems tooo aggressive of a prediction to me.  Did you just pull these numbers out of the air, or do you have some solid quantitative rational behind them?\r\n\r\nAlso, I\'m interested in more of what you can do and what you have planned for swapper mail.\r\n\r\n\r\n','2013-08-23 02:09:09','2013-08-23 02:09:09'),(2544,96,48,'Hi guys, newbie here.

There is the initial cause of a perception of red, which is when something reflects something like 650 NM light.  Very different form this is you knowledge of the strawberry, or the final result of the perception process.  So you must realize that when you say \'red\' the way you are, you are revealing your ignorance on this issue, and it seems to me not talking nor thinking clearly about things.\r\n\r\nA \'redness quality\' is something very different than a causal property, like reflecting 650 NM light.  Our brain merely uses our \'redness quality\' to represent the latter.  And of course, you could have inverted qualia, by inverting the read green signal anywhere in the perception process.  In other words, if you invert it, your brain will then represent the strawberry with greenness, and the leaves with redness.\r\n\r\nIf you fully understand that, we can move on to better understand this neuro substitution fallacy, and why the causal properties of glutamate could be one and the same as the qualitative properties of redness, which we experience, and represent the strawberry with (that is unless we have inverted color glasses).\r\n\r\nBrent\r\n\r\n','2013-11-04 18:14:12','2013-11-04 18:14:12'),(2587,96,48,'Hi Brent,\r\n\r\nI only mention my view to give some indication of how it might be received by those do not subscribe to popular views on the subject.

Indeed, we can mechanically press on our own eyeball, or dream in color to produce color without having a corresponding photon release. This is easier to think about with the other senses. If we imagine the flavors of a Thanksgiving dinner, we do not expect that there is anything which can be found in the brain that literally smells like turkey, stuffing, cranberries, etc.\r\n\r\nEven in the most materialistic perspective, the existence of color would be much more likely to be rooted in biology than electromagnetism.

I just recently added the required additional paragraph to the end of the abstract:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1fQeWrCjXp-kO18NRfrNJrropqaLMdaBrMq7c9KbqtdE/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nSo I say the same thing to you, Rich.  Do you agree that the neural substitution argument is problematic, and that this argument is a big reason for why so many functionalists, are functionalists?\r\n\r\nCertainly you must agree that there is some neural correlate, that includes some necessary and sufficient physical conditions, in order for one to experience an elemental redness quality?  Certainly, you must be able to reliably detect whatever this is, if you assume consciousness is approachable via science.  And certainly, we  must be able to find a way to avoid the quale interpretation problem, and represent the same thing in someone else\'s brain, whatever it is, and thereby reliably eff the ineffable, solve the problem of other minds, and so on.\r\n\r\nIf you remove the binding mechanism from the picture, then the functionalists will go right back to their neural substitution argument that has the fallacy which is keeping them from understanding what is important.  Remember, think of glutamate as just the idealized or symbolic representation.  Feel free to interpret it as whatever you could think are the necessary and sufficient set of physical properties that is the neural correlate to an elemental redness quality we can reliably experience.\r\n\r\nIf I\'m still missing what you are getting at, perhaps you can help me understand what you mean by \"Why not keep the account at the general level?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n','2013-11-05 11:36:52','2013-11-05 11:36:52'),(2605,96,48,'Rich,\r\n\r\n\"There is no contradiction in the idea that the part of the cortex which provides vision in sighted people can provide touch in the blind.\"\r\n\r\nMy point was that whether activity is in the visual cortex or not cannot be the determining factor in whether vision is provided. Providing access to certain sense modalities is not the same thing as saying that they are \"in\" a certain part of the brain, anymore than I can say that Canonizer is \"in\" certain parts of my computer or screen.\r\n\r\nCraig','2013-11-05 12:38:54','2013-11-05 12:38:54'),(2608,96,48,'Brent\r\n\r\nYou ask \" Do you agree that the neural substitution argument is problematic, and that this argument is a big reason for why so many functionalists, are functionalists?\"\r\n\r\nYes, i agree. If functionalism were true then it is obvious that substitution of any or all neurons with functional equivalents would result in no change. The prevalent view is that neurons are computational devices and so you could program a suitably powerful computer to emulate the brain, consciousness included. This is wrong IMO.\r\n\r\nYes i agree that there is an NCC and so consciousness is approachable via scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nAs someone who knows a thing or two about molecular biology, the idea that glutamate could represent the the experience of red is absurd and incoherent and so should be dropped from the statement.\r\n\r\nThe single neuron theory of binding is IMO fanciful and should also be dropped. By all means talk about the binding problem but why cite this specific theory? Is there is a lot of support for it on canonizer?\r\n\r\nI advise keeping it more general because these specifics - the neurotransmitter example and the single neuron theory - will, i suspect, cause many scientists to simply dismiss canonizer as fringe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2013-11-15 11:11:46','2013-11-15 11:11:46'),(2611,96,48,'Craig\r\n\r\nAgreed that mere detection of some activity cannot tell you what type of experience is occurring, indeed cannot even tell if any is occurring - it could be unconscious.\r\n\r\nThis is, however, a limitation of our current brain scanning techniques.  When we can detect the NCC this will be possible. In your example, a future brain scan will show whether visual experience or touch experience is occurring.\r\n','2013-11-15 11:23:29','2013-11-15 11:23:29'),(2614,96,48,'Rich, \r\n\r\nYou said,\r\n\r\n\"a future brain scan will show whether visual experience or\r\ntouch experience is occurring.\"\r\n\r\nThat may be, but still only retrospectively. The brain scan is showing only that a the brain activity belongs to one pre-established category or another. These categories are mathematical descriptions so that any connection between them and the actual aesthetic difference between subjective visual or tactile modes must be inferred by human beings. \r\n\r\nIt is a bit like saying \"a future analysis of ballot boxes will show whether Republican or Democrats take more pride in their candidate.\"\r\n\r\nIn both cases, what is lacking is the prospective view. The brain scan cannot tell what a new kind of sense looks like, because it has no familiarity with sense at all, only a mathematical description of brain activity. The voting booth can\'t really know what pride is, it can only deduce statistically what chad belongs to which inferred category.\r\n\r\n','2013-11-15 14:26:46','2013-11-15 14:26:46'),(2617,96,48,'Hi Craig,\r\n\r\nThis conversation is the greatest!  Everything you say is correct, but you are still missing a critically important \'effing\' possibility.\r\n\r\nYou are right, if you detect the neural correlate of your redness, all such detection will be is abstract information that suffers from the \"quale interpretation problem\".\r\n\r\nSo, in order to overcome this quale interpretation problem, we simply need to direct that same detector to my brain, and show me different colored objects until it detects the neural correlate for your redness.\r\n\r\nInverted qualia is a definite possibility such as your redness could be what my brain uses for greenness.  So I would say: \"Wow, that\'s not my redness, that\'s my greenness!\"\r\n\r\nAnd surely there will be various types of diversity and variability between people such as different types of tetrachromats and trichromats, (even if only artificially modified).  This will make it possible to validate that you reliably have consistent and reliable map of neural correlates to the set of all possible elemental qualities, enabling one to fully know how to properly interpreted any detected neural correlates.\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n','2013-11-15 22:44:25','2013-11-15 22:44:25'),(2620,96,48,'Hi Brent,\r\n\r\nThe example of color is actually a little deceiving, compared to something like flavor. It is easy to make an unsupported leap from abstract information to color because we can visualize the data as some kind of code or arrangement of bits and color as the same kind of thing, only with colored pixels. Of all the senses, visual sense is most isomorphic to public forms and functions. We can picture an (inverted) physical image on our retina that then is simply moved into the visual cortex as some kind of Fourier transform. Just as the fragmentation of sectors on a hard drive or memory paging through RAM does not give us an isomorphic image of the user content, we are still very comfortable with the idea of the user experience being reconstituted somehow, without having to be formally represented. The formal representation, while still somewhat mysteriously absent, plays a very conventional role of being simply a particular encoding format. Visual qualia can just be a compression algorithm and we leave it at that.\r\n\r\nTactile qualia also has a lot of easy-isomorphism that we can treat that way without much thought. Something like olfactory qualia, or auditory qualia present a better example of why the explanatory gap/quale interpretation problem goes far beyond data encoding. The entire issue of effability seems beside the point to me. Qualia is ineffable because it is private, but privacy or uniqueness in and of itself doesn\'t challenge our view of physics. It is not that my green may be your red, but that our Thanksgiving turkey flavor is an experience of flavor rather than a quantitatively compressed data set. The elephant in the room, for me, is not the quale interpretation problem, but the need for any additional aesthetic \"interpretation\" at all.\r\n\r\nCraig','2013-11-16 00:08:36','2013-11-16 00:08:36'),(2623,96,48,'\r\n\r\nTheoreticians,\r\n\r\nThanks to the help of James Carroll, and many others, I think I\'ve significantly improved the 500 word abstract, and made it much more clear.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1fQeWrCjXp-kO18NRfrNJrropqaLMdaBrMq7c9KbqtdE/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nI\'d love to know if you guys agree that it is better.\r\n\r\nBrent Allsop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2013-11-24 20:07:29','2013-11-24 20:07:29'),(2624,1,70,'\r\n\r\nNeener, Neener, Neener.

The goal is to come out with a master list which correlates each road sign and each position to the specific functions of French society - the fashion, the food, the language, the art, etc. The fact that this can be done, while useful in actually being able to fix French cities more effectively if they are damaged, does not mean that the assumption of a causal connection between road signs and culture exists.
